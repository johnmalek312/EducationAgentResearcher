      "is_correct": true,
      "full_response": "Rationale: The most plausible true statement among the options, based on the provided context, is that a student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College. While the context doesn't explicitly state a specific attendance percentage for ELICOS colleges, it heavily emphasizes the quality and standards of ELICOS programs in Australia.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **International students in Australian universities attend separate classes to local students.** The context describes Australian schools and society as multicultural and welcoming to international students. It mentions teachers being experienced in teaching classes to students from many different countries and cultures. This suggests integration rather than segregation in classes. There is no information suggesting separate classes for international students in universities.\n\n*   **A student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College.**  The context highlights the quality assurance of ELICOS programs and the support services available for international students in these colleges. It is a reasonable inference that to maintain quality and ensure student progress, ELICOS colleges would have attendance requirements. While the exact percentage of 80% is not mentioned, a minimum attendance policy is a common practice in educational institutions to ensure effective learning. This option is plausible within the context's emphasis on quality ELICOS programs.\n\n*   **International students receive better treatment than domestic students.** The context mentions support services for international students, but this is to help them adjust to a new environment and succeed in their studies. It does not imply that international students receive preferential treatment over domestic students. The focus is on providing necessary support, not better treatment.\n\n*   **A student studying in an undergraduate program is more likely to enter into a Certificate IV than a Graduate diploma program upon completion of the undergraduate program.**  An undergraduate program is typically a Bachelor's degree, which is a higher qualification than a Certificate IV. A Graduate Diploma is a postgraduate qualification, which is a higher qualification than a Bachelor's degree.  It is more logical for a student to progress to a higher qualification (Graduate Diploma) after completing an undergraduate program than to regress to a lower qualification (Certificate IV). The context in 'b1-overview.md' mentions that student visa holders must maintain enrolment at the same or higher AQF level. This option contradicts the typical progression in education and the AQF framework.\n\nConsidering the emphasis on quality and standards in ELICOS programs, and the plausibility of attendance requirements in educational settings, the most likely true statement is that a student should attend at least 80% of scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College. While not explicitly stated, it is the most reasonable inference among the given options within the context provided.\n\nRationale: Option 2 is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal Answer: A student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College.\n\nSources:\n1.
