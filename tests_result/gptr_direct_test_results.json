      "full_response": "# Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) Creation Process in Australia: A Detailed Report\n\nThe Australian international education sector is undergoing significant changes in 2025, particularly concerning the student visa application process. A key element of these changes is the mandatory requirement for a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for student visa applications, especially for those lodged onshore. This report aims to provide a detailed overview of how CoEs are created, the systems involved, and the implications of these changes for international students.\n\n## What is a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)?\n\nA Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is an official document issued by an Australian educational institution to an international student, confirming their acceptance into a registered course ([Meridean Overseas](https://www.meridean.org/blog/confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-in-australia)). It serves as proof that the student has been accepted into a course registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([UniCreds Blog](https://unicreds.com/blog/coe-for-australia/)). The CoE includes vital information such as the student's personal details, course details (name, code, CRICOS code, tuition fees, and duration), and institution details ([UniCreds Blog](https://unicreds.com/blog/coe-for-australia/)).\n\n## The Transition to Mandatory CoE\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the Australian Department of Home Affairs no longer accepts Letters of Offer as sufficient documentation for student visa applications lodged from within Australia ([Auzworld Migration](https://www.auzworldmigration.com.au/student-visa-changes-2025-coe-mandatory-offer-not-accepted/), [Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/), [Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/), [VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). This change mandates that international students must provide a CoE to demonstrate a genuine commitment to studying in Australia ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)). The transition aims to enhance the integrity of the international education sector by ensuring that only serious students are granted visas ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n## The Role of PRISMS\n\nThe Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) is a critical component in the CoE creation process ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project/resources/prisms-coe-create-input-data-requirements), [PRISMS Logon](https://prisms.education.gov.au/)). PRISMS is a system used by Australian education providers to manage and report on their international students ([PRISMS Logon](https://prisms.education.gov.au/)). It ensures compliance with the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Legislation ([PRISMS Logon](https://prisms.education.gov.au/)).\n\n### Data Requirements for CoE Creation in PRISMS\n\nTo create a CoE in PRISMS, educational institutions must provide specific data inputs. These data requirements are detailed in the \"PRISMS CoE Create Input Data Requirements\" document provided by the Department of Education ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project/resources/prisms-coe-create-input-data-requirements)). This document is designed to assist software system vendors and education providers in verifying the PRISMS data held within their Admission Management Systems (AMS) and Student Management Systems (SMS) ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project/resources/prisms-coe-create-input-data-requirements)).\n\n### PRISMS API Functionality\n\nThe Department of Education is working on enhancing PRISMS with API (Application Programming Interface) functionality. This will allow for more seamless integration between education providers' internal systems and PRISMS, streamlining the CoE creation process ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project/resources/prisms-coe-create-input-data-requirements)).\n\n## Steps to Obtain a CoE\n\nThe process for international students to obtain a CoE typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Application and Acceptance:** The student applies to an Australian educational institution and receives a Letter of Offer ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n2.  **Formal Acceptance:** The student formally accepts the offer from the university ([International AskUNE](https://internationalaskune.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1604/~/obtaining-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-(coe))).\n3.  **Tuition Fee Payment:** The student pays a portion or all of their tuition fees as required by the institution ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n4.  **Confirmation of Enrolment Issuance:** The educational institution issues a CoE through PRISMS, confirming the student's enrolment in a specific course ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n## Implications for International Students\n\nThe mandatory CoE requirement has several implications for international students:\n\n### Increased Financial Burden\n\nObtaining a CoE requires upfront tuition payments, adding to the financial burden on international students ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Coupled with the increased visa fee of AUD 1,600 (as of July 2024), students must demonstrate sufficient financial resources to cover these costs ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/), [VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Stricter Visa Requirements\n\nThe new rule tightens the visa application process, ensuring that only genuine students who have formally committed to studying in Australia are granted visas ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Risk of Visa Rejection\n\nSubmitting a visa application without a CoE will result in the application being deemed invalid, and the applicant will not be eligible for a Bridging Visa, potentially leading to a loss of legal status in Australia ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n\n### Need for Early Preparation\n\nStudents must start the application process early to secure their CoE in time ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). This includes applying to institutions that can issue CoEs quickly once all enrollment requirements are met ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n## Exemptions\n\nCertain categories of students are exempt from the mandatory CoE requirement. These include students participating in Foreign Affairs, Defense, and secondary exchange programs, who are allowed to submit alternative forms of evidence ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n\n## Other Recent Policy Updates\n\nIn addition to the mandatory CoE requirement, several other policy updates have been implemented:\n\n### Enrollment Cap\n\nA limit of 270,000 international student enrollments has been established for the year 2025 ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/), [Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Ministerial Direction 111 (MD111)\n\nMinisterial Direction 111 (MD111) was implemented in December 2024 to streamline the processing of offshore student visa applications ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/]). This directive replaces the earlier Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107) ([Vino Education Consulting](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/]).\n\n### Core Skills Occupation List\n\nThe introduction of the Core Skills Occupation List in 2025 may influence post-study plans, affecting opportunities for students to transition to work visas in high-demand fields after graduation ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe mandatory CoE requirement for Australian student visas in 2025 represents a significant shift in the application process. While it introduces additional steps and financial considerations, the policy aims to ensure that genuine students benefit from a streamlined and fair system ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)). International students must understand these changes, plan their applications accordingly, and ensure compliance with the new regulations to achieve their educational goals in Australia ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)). The PRISMS system, managed by the Department of Education, plays a vital role in this process, ensuring that educational institutions properly manage and report on their international students.\n\n## References\n\nAuzworld Migration Ptv.

      "full_response": "## Legislation and Regulations in Australia Relating to the Enrolment of International Students in 2025: A Detailed Report\n\nAustralia's international education sector has undergone significant changes in recent years, particularly with the introduction of new legislation and regulations in 2025. These changes reflect the government's efforts to manage the growth of the sector, ensure the quality of education, and address concerns related to infrastructure and housing pressures ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)). This report provides a detailed overview of the key regulations and their implications for international students seeking to study in Australia.\n\n### Key Changes in 2025\n\nThe Australian government has implemented several significant changes to its international student policies, effective January 1, 2025. These include:\n\n1.  **Cap on International Student Enrolments:** A National Planning Level (NPL) cap of 270,000 new international student commencements has been introduced for 2025 ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)). This cap aims to balance the expansion of the education sector with infrastructure and economic sustainability ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n2.  **Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** A Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is now mandatory for all student visa applications, replacing the previous Letter of Offer system ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). This requirement applies to both onshore and offshore applications and aims to ensure that only genuine students are granted visas ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n3.  **Stricter Visa Requirements:** The government has introduced stricter visa requirements, including higher English language proficiency standards and a \"Genuine Student\" requirement ([Times of India, 2024](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/australia/australia-caps-international-student-enrollments-starting-2025-new-visa-rules-and-enrollment-limits-for-international-students/articleshow/113378868.cms)).\n\n4.  **Increased Visa Fees:** The international student visa fee has significantly increased, rising from AUD 710 to AUD 1,600 as of July 1, 2024 ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### National Planning Level (NPL) Cap\n\nThe NPL cap of 270,000 new international student commencements is a key component of the new regulations. This cap is distributed among different education sectors as follows ([Times of India, 2024](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/australia/australia-caps-international-student-enrollments-starting-2025-new-visa-rules-and-enrollment-limits-for-international-students/articleshow/113378868.cms)):\n\n*   Public Universities: 145,000\n*   Vocational Education and Training (VET): 95,000\n*   Private Universities and Non-University Higher Education Providers (NUHEPs): 30,000\n\nThis distribution favors public institutions, potentially creating challenges for private providers that have experienced significant growth in recent years ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)). The cap does not affect current international students already enrolled in Australian institutions but will limit the intake of new students ([Times of India, 2024](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/australia/australia-caps-international-student-enrollments-starting-2025-new-visa-rules-and-enrollment-limits-for-international-students/articleshow/113378868.cms)). Certain categories of students are also excluded from the cap, including:\n\n*   International school students\n*   Higher degree by research students\n*   Students undertaking standalone English language courses\n*   Non-award students\n*   Government-sponsored scholars*   Students in transnational education arrangements\n*   Key partner foreign government scholarship holders\n*   Students from the Pacific and Timor-Leste ([ABC News, 2024](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-27/international-student-caps-higher-education/104274056))\n\nThe individual caps for each university are determined by factors such as recent levels of new international student commencements and the concentration of international enrolments in their onshore student cohorts ([ABC News, 2024](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-27/international-student-caps-higher-education/104274056)).\n\n### Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)\n\nThe mandatory CoE requirement is a significant change to the student visa application process. A CoE is an official electronic document issued by Australian educational institutions, confirming a student's enrolment in a registered course ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)). To obtain a CoE, students must:\n\n*   Gain admission to a registered course\n*   Pay the required tuition fees\n*   Request a CoE from the institution ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/))\n\nApplications without a CoE will be deemed invalid and will not be processed ([Blog.Admission.ac, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). This change aims to prevent the misuse of student visas and ensure that only genuine students enter Australia ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)). Previously, some individuals used student visas to enter the country without enrolling in educational programs ([VisaandImmigrations.com, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-mandatory-coe-for-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Implications and Challenges\n\nThe new regulations have several implications for international students and the Australian education sector:\n\n*   **Increased Financial Burden:** The mandatory CoE requires upfront tuition payments, and the increased visa fee adds to the financial burden for prospective students ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Stricter Requirements for Onshore Applications:** The updated policy restricts onshore applications for candidates on temporary visas, making it more difficult to switch to a student visa from within Australia ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Potential Impact on Workforce and Research:** Reduced student numbers could lead to skill shortages in critical fields and impact Australia's research capabilities ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)).\n*   **Economic Concerns:** The international education sector is a significant economic contributor, and the cap could adversely impact Australia's economy and global standing as a premier education destination ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)).\n*   **Challenges for Private Providers:** The allocation of places within the cap may pose challenges for private providers, which have experienced growth in recent years ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-sets-2025-cap-on-international-student-enrolments/)).\n\n### Advice for Prospective Students\n\nGiven the new regulations, prospective international students should take the following steps:\n\n*   **Prepare Early:** Secure a CoE well before the visa application deadline ([AcmeMigration.com, 2025](https://acmemigration.com/australia-introduces-new-rules-for-student-visa-applications-in-2025/)).\n*   **Meet Financial Requirements:** Account for upfront tuition payments and the increased visa fee ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).*   **Improve English Proficiency:** Aim for an IELTS score above the minimum requirement to strengthen the application ([Blog.Admission.ac, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n*   **Monitor Visa Validity:** Keep track of the visa's expiration date to avoid losing lawful status ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Consult with Educational Institutions:** Seek guidance from educational institutions for timely advice on visa policies and application steps ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAustralia's new legislation and regulations for international students in 2025 represent a significant shift in its education migration strategy. The introduction of the NPL cap and the mandatory CoE requirement aim to manage the growth of the sector, ensure the quality of education, and address concerns related to infrastructure and housing pressures. While these changes may present challenges for some students and institutions, they also reflect the government's commitment to maintaining a sustainable and high-quality international education sector. Prospective students must stay informed and prepare accordingly to navigate the new landscape and achieve their educational goals in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nAcme Migration.

      "full_response": "## Reporting Obligations of Educational Institutions Through PRISMS in Australia\n\nThe Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) is a crucial tool in Australia's international education sector, facilitating the management and monitoring of international student data. Managed by the Australian Department of Education, PRISMS ensures that education providers comply with the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act. This system allows for the electronic issuance of Confirmation of Enrolments (CoEs), which are essential for student visa applications, and helps track the enrolment status and course progress of international students ([Meshed Group, 2024](https://meshedgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HigherEdResources/pages/2489057891/PRISMS+Provider+Registration+and+International+Student+Management+System)).\n\nGiven the importance of PRISMS in maintaining the integrity of Australia\u2019s international education framework, it is essential for education providers to understand their reporting obligations. This report aims to identify circumstances that are *not* typically reported online through PRISMS by educational institutions, based on the information provided by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) and the Department of Education.\n\n### Core Reporting Obligations via PRISMSCRICOS (Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students) providers play a vital role in the well-functioning of Vocational Education and Training (VET) and English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sectors. These providers are mandated to report specific information through PRISMS to ensure compliance with regulatory standards ([ASQA, n.d.a](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/reporting-obligations-summary)). The key reporting obligations include:\n\n1.  **Individual Student Information:** This encompasses a range of details about each student, including their full name, gender, date of birth, country of birth, and nationality ([ASQA, n.d.b](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/what-information-do-you-need-report)). For students under 18, additional information such as the residential address, mobile phone number, and email address of a legal guardian is also required ([ASQA, n.d.b](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/what-information-do-you-need-report)).\n\n2.  **Enrollment Details:** Providers must report on accepted students, including the unique identifier of the student\u2019s course (CRICOS course code), the agreed starting date, and the expected completion date ([ASQA, n.d.b](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/what-information-do-you-need-report)). They also need to report the amount of tuition and non-tuition fees received from the student ([ASQA, n.d.b](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/what-information-do-you-need-report)).\n\n3.  **Changes in Enrollment:** Any changes to a student\u2019s enrollment status must be reported. This includes non-commencement of studies, termination of studies before course completion, deferrals, and suspensions ([ASQA, n.d.a](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/reporting-obligations-summary)). Providers must also report changes to a student\u2019s identity or the duration of their course ([ASQA, n.d.a](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/reporting-obligations-summary)).\n\n4.  **Course-Related Issues:** If a course does not start as expected, or if there are changes to the course itself, these must be reported ([ASQA, n.d.a](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/reporting-obligations-summary)).\n\n5.  **Education Agents:** Information about education agents used by the provider must also be reported ([ASQA, n.d.a](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/reporting-obligations-summary)).\n\n### Circumstances NOT Typically Reported Online Through PRISMS\n\nBased on the provided information, it can be inferred that certain internal processes and specific details related to student welfare arrangements, complaints, and appeals are *not* directly reported online through PRISMS. These include:\n\n1.  **Internal Welfare and Accommodation Arrangements:** While providers must report if a student under 18 refuses to maintain approved welfare and accommodation arrangements, the specific details of these arrangements are not directly reported in PRISMS ([Wesley College, n.d.](https://www.wesleycollege.edu.au/about-wesley/governance/policies/international-student-deferment,-suspension-and-cancellation-policy)). PRISMS is used to notify changes or breaches, but the initial setup and ongoing management of these arrangements are managed internally and documented separately. Additional information regarding care arrangements can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website, indicating that the reporting is event-driven rather than a continuous feed of welfare details ([Department of Education, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/frequently-asked-questions)).\n\n2.  **Details of Complaints and Appeals Processes:** If a student accesses an educational institution's complaints and appeals process regarding a school-initiated suspension or cancellation, the suspension or cancellation is typically *not* reported in PRISMS until the complaints and appeals process is finalized ([Wesley College, n.d.](https://www.wesleycollege.edu.au/about-wesley/governance/policies/international-student-deferment,-suspension-and-cancellation-policy)). This is to ensure that the outcome of the appeal is considered before reporting the change in enrollment status. However, there are exceptions for extenuating circumstances related to the welfare of the student, such as if the student is missing, has medical concerns, or poses a risk to themselves or others ([Wesley College, n.d.](https://www.wesleycollege.edu.au/about-wesley/governance/policies/international-student-deferment,-suspension-and-cancellation-policy)).\n\n3.  **Internal Documentation of Contractual and Financial Relationships:** While providers must report tuition fees received, the detailed documentation of the contractual and financial relationship between the students and the institution is generally kept internally ([Law Insider, n.d.a](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prisms)). PRISMS is used to report the aggregate amounts, but the specifics of payment plans, scholarships, or other financial arrangements are managed and documented separately.\n\n4.  **Reasons for Suspension (Unless Specific Welfare Concerns):** The general reasons for a suspension, such as academic performance issues, might not be reported in detail through PRISMS unless they trigger specific welfare concerns. PRISMS reporting is more focused on the fact of the suspension and its impact on the student's CoE rather than the granular details of why the suspension occurred ([Policies SCU, n.d.](https://policies.scu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00006)).\n\n5.  **Deferments Not Affecting CoE End Date:** If a university defers or suspends a student's enrollment for a period without affecting the end date of the CoE, there is no change to the CoE or the student's enrollment status on PRISMS. However, the notice of deferment or suspension will be recorded in PRISMS and sent on to DOHA for future reference ([Policies SCU, n.d.](https://policies.scu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00006)).\n\n### Rationale and Implications\n\nThe rationale behind *not* reporting these specific circumstances directly through PRISMS is likely due to several factors:\n\n*   **Privacy and Data Minimization:** Detailed welfare arrangements and internal complaints processes may contain sensitive personal information that is not necessary for the core functions of PRISMS, which are primarily focused on visa compliance and enrollment management.\n\n*   **Administrative Burden:** Requiring providers to report every detail of internal processes would create a significant administrative burden without necessarily improving the effectiveness of the system.\n\n*   **Focus on Outcomes:** PRISMS is primarily concerned with the outcomes of these processes (e.g., suspension, cancellation, deferral) rather than the details of how those outcomes were reached.\n\nThe implications of this approach are that educational institutions must maintain robust internal systems for managing student welfare, complaints, and financial arrangements, even though these details are not directly reported through PRISMS. This requires institutions to have well-documented policies and procedures, as well as trained staff to handle these issues effectively.\n\n### The PRISMS Modernisation Project\n\nIt is also worth noting the ongoing PRISMS Modernisation Project, which aims to streamline enrollments and improve the user experience for education providers ([Department of Education, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project)). This project involves developing an Application Programming Interface (API) that will allow education provider software vendors to connect their systems directly to PRISMS, reducing double data handling and improving the efficiency of reporting ([Department of Education, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project)). While this project will likely improve the efficiency and accuracy of reporting, it is unlikely to significantly change the types of information that are reported through PRISMS. The focus remains on core enrollment data and changes in enrollment status, rather than the detailed internal processes of educational institutions. The project commenced in July 2022 and is expected to save the International Education sector an estimated $10 million in regulatory compliance costs each year ([Department of Education, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/prisms-modernisation-project)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while PRISMS serves as a comprehensive system for reporting key information about international students and their enrollments, certain internal processes and specific details are *not* typically reported online through PRISMS. These include the specifics of internal welfare and accommodation arrangements, details of complaints and appeals processes until finalization (unless extenuating circumstances apply), internal documentation of contractual and financial relationships, and the granular reasons for suspension unless they trigger specific welfare concerns. This division of responsibilities requires educational institutions to maintain robust internal systems for managing these aspects of student life, ensuring compliance with the ESOS Act and providing a supportive environment for international students.\n\n**References**\n\nASQA.

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the scenario of an international student in Australia who has become ill and hospitalized without providing a current address to their institution.\n\n### Report: Implications of an International Student's Unreported Address During Hospitalization in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe welfare of international students studying in Australia is governed by a comprehensive framework designed to protect their rights and ensure their safety and well-being. When an international student is hospitalized and has not provided their educational institution with a current address, several critical issues arise. These issues span visa compliance, duty of care, emergency contact procedures, and the institution's legal obligations under Australian law. This report will explore the ramifications of such a scenario, drawing upon relevant legislation, guidelines, and resources to provide a comprehensive analysis.\n\n**Visa Compliance and Reporting Obligations**\n\nOne of the primary concerns when an international student fails to provide a current address is the potential breach of their visa conditions. The Department of Home Affairs mandates that international students maintain accurate and up-to-date contact details with their education provider ([UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities)). Both the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and Deakin University explicitly state that students must notify the institution within seven days of any change to their residential address, mobile number, personal email address, or emergency contact ([Deakin](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/study-support/international/update-contact-details), [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities)).\n\nFailure to comply with this requirement places the student in breach of their visa conditions, which can have severe consequences, including visa cancellation ([UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities)). Educational institutions are obligated to monitor student enrolment and notify the Department of Home Affairs of any breaches ([UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities)). This reporting mechanism is part of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) framework, which ensures the quality and integrity of education services provided to international students ([Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/)).\n\nThe ESOS Act 2000 provides the legal framework governing the delivery of education to overseas students on a student visa in Australia. It covers the registration process and obligations of registered providers, the Tuition Protection Service, and enforcement and compliance powers ([Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/)). Information provided to the government under the ESOS Act is managed through the Provider Registration and International Students Management System (PRISMS) ([Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/)).\n\n**Duty of Care and Welfare Obligations**\n\nBeyond visa compliance, educational institutions have a duty of care to ensure the welfare and safety of their students. This duty is particularly pronounced for international students, who may be far from home and lack a local support network. When a student is hospitalized, the institution's ability to provide adequate support is significantly compromised if they do not have accurate contact information.\n\nVictoria University's (VU) Safety and Welfare of Children and Young People - International Student Welfare Procedure outlines the responsibilities of the university in supporting international students, especially those under 18 ([VU](https://policy.vu.edu.au/document/view.php?id=392)). While this procedure specifically addresses students under 18, the principles of welfare and support extend to all international students. VU provides various support services, including access to housing services, general welfare support, and a point of contact in case of an emergency ([VU](https://policy.vu.edu.au/document/view.php?id=392)).\n\nIn the event of a student's hospitalization, the institution's inability to contact the student's family or emergency contacts due to outdated information can lead to delays in providing necessary medical information, emotional support, and financial assistance. This situation can exacerbate the student's distress and hinder their recovery.\n\n**Emergency Contact Procedures and Communication**\n\nHaving accurate emergency contact information is crucial in any crisis situation. When a student is hospitalized, the institution needs to be able to quickly reach out to the student's designated emergency contacts, who may be family members or close friends. These contacts can provide critical medical history, insurance details, and other essential information that can aid in the student's treatment and care.\n\nWithout this information, the institution may struggle to make informed decisions about the student's welfare and may face legal and ethical challenges in managing the situation. The institution's inability to communicate effectively with the student's family can also lead to increased anxiety and stress for both the student and their loved ones.\n\n**Privacy and Confidentiality Considerations**\n\nWhile institutions have a responsibility to support their students, they must also adhere to strict privacy and confidentiality laws. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) govern the handling of personal information, including medical information ([Complispace](https://www.complispace.com.au/top-operational-and-strategic-risks-for-schools-in-2020)). Institutions must ensure that they collect, use, and disclose personal information in accordance with these principles.\n\nIn the context of a student's hospitalization, institutions must balance the need to gather and share information to provide adequate care with the obligation to protect the student's privacy. This requires careful consideration of the legal and ethical implications of each action taken.\n\n**Mental Health and Well-being**The hospitalization of an international student can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being. Being in a foreign country, away from family and friends, and facing a medical crisis can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. Institutions must be prepared to provide mental health support to students in these situations.\n\nComplispace's report on the top operational and strategic risks for schools in 2020 highlights the importance of monitoring and supporting students suffering from anxiety and stress ([Complispace](https://www.complispace.com.au/top-operational-and-strategic-risks-for-schools-in-2020)). The report emphasizes the need for clear communication, accessible feedback mechanisms, and trained staff to address students' mental health concerns.\n\n**Addressing the Issue: Proactive Measures and Corrective Actions**\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with students not providing current addresses, institutions should implement proactive measures to ensure that they have accurate contact information for all international students. These measures may include:\n\n1.  **Mandatory Address Verification:** Requiring students to verify their address and emergency contact information at regular intervals, such as at the beginning of each semester.\n2.  **User-Friendly Update Systems:** Providing students with easy-to-use online systems for updating their contact details.\n3.  **Reminders and Notifications:** Sending regular reminders to students to update their information, especially before holidays or breaks.\n4.  **Integration with Enrollment Systems:** Integrating contact information updates with the institution's enrollment and student management systems.\n5.  **Clear Communication of Obligations:** Clearly communicating the importance of providing accurate contact information and the potential consequences of failing to do so.\n\nIn the event that an institution discovers that a student has not provided a current address, they should take immediate corrective action to locate the student and update their records. This may involve:\n\n1.  **Contacting the Student's Emergency Contacts:** Reaching out to the student's listed emergency contacts to inquire about their whereabouts.\n2.  **Checking Enrollment Records:** Reviewing enrollment records to see if there is any additional contact information available.\n3.  **Contacting Other Students:** Reaching out to other students who may know the student's current address.\n4.  **Collaborating with Local Authorities:** Working with local authorities, such as the police or hospitals, to locate the student.\n\n**The Role of Technology and Support Services**\n\nOrganizations like MissingSchool provide technology and support services to help students stay connected to their education and social networks during periods of illness ([MissingSchool](https://missingschool.org.au/)). Their telepresence service allows sick children to participate in classroom activities remotely, reducing feelings of isolation and maintaining their academic progress.\n\nWhile MissingSchool primarily focuses on children with chronic illnesses, their model of using technology to support students who are absent from school can be adapted to assist international students who are hospitalized. Institutions can explore partnerships with organizations like MissingSchool to provide additional support to students in need.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe scenario of an international student being hospitalized without providing a current address to their institution presents a complex set of challenges. It raises concerns about visa compliance, duty of care, emergency contact procedures, privacy, and student well-being. To address these challenges, institutions must implement proactive measures to ensure that they have accurate contact information for all international students and be prepared to take immediate corrective action when a student's address is outdated.\n\nBy prioritizing the welfare and safety of international students and adhering to their legal and ethical obligations, educational institutions can create a supportive and inclusive environment that promotes student success and well-being. The integration of technology and support services can further enhance the institution's ability to assist students in times of crisis, ensuring that they receive the care and support they need to thrive in their academic pursuits.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Chubb.

      "full_response": "# Impact of School Closure on International Students in Australia: A Detailed Report\n\nThe closure of an educational institution can be a distressing event for any student, but it presents unique challenges for international students studying in Australia. These students often face visa implications, financial uncertainties, and the need to quickly find alternative educational arrangements. Based on recent policy updates and support systems in place, this report examines the likely outcomes for an international student whose school in Australia has been forced to close.\n\n## Overview of the SituationAs of early 2025, several Australian educational institutions have faced closures due to various reasons, including financial difficulties and regulatory non-compliance ([Department of Education, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/notices/tps)). The Tuition Protection Service (TPS) has been activated in response to these closures to assist affected students ([Department of Education, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/notices/tps)). The TPS is a government initiative designed to support international students in the event of a provider default, ensuring they can either continue their studies in a suitable alternative course or receive a refund for unused tuition fees ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n\n## Likely Outcomes for Affected Students\n\nWhen a school closes, international students are likely to experience the following:\n\n### 1. Tuition Protection Service (TPS) Intervention\n\nThe TPS is the primary safety net for international students when a provider defaults ([The Koala News, 2024](https://thekoalanews.com/sector-concerns-regarding-processes-after-provider-closure/)). The TPS will contact affected students and provide information on available options, including:\n\n*   **Placement in a Suitable Alternative Course:** The TPS will assist students in finding a similar course at another registered provider. This ensures minimal disruption to their studies, and credit may be granted for studies already completed ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n*   **Refund of Unused Tuition Fees:** If a student cannot find a suitable alternative course, the TPS will arrange a refund of the unused portion of their tuition fees ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n\n### 2. Visa Implications\n\nA school closure can have significant implications for a student's visa. The student visa (subclass 500) requires students to be enrolled in a registered course ([Migration Expert, 2024](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/studying-in-australia/navigating-new-opportunities-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)). If the student is no longer enrolled due to the closure, they must take swift action to maintain their visa status ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Enrollment in a New Course:** The student must enroll in a new course with a registered provider as soon as possible. Once enrolled, they need to update their visa details via ImmiAccount to reflect the new provider and course details ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n*   **Time Frame to Act:** There is a limited time frame to enroll in a new course. Failure to do so may lead to visa cancellation ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n\n### 3. Financial Considerations\n\nThe closure of a school can create financial challenges for international students.\n\n*   **Refunds and Re-credits:** The TPS ensures that students receive refunds for unused tuition fees, which can help alleviate some financial stress ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n*   **Additional Costs:** Students may incur additional costs related to finding a new course, such as application fees or differences in tuition fees between institutions.\n\n### 4. Academic Disruption\n\nThe closure inevitably disrupts the student's academic progress.\n\n*   **Transfer of Credits:** The TPS and the new education provider will work to ensure that the student receives credit for the studies they have already completed ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n*   **Potential Delays:** Despite efforts to minimize disruption, students may experience some delays in completing their studies due to the need to adjust to a new institution and course.\n\n### 5. Support Services\n\nSeveral support services are available to assist international students during this challenging time.\n\n*   **Education Agents:** Education agents can provide guidance and support in finding a new course and navigating the visa process ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n*   **TPS Information Sessions:** The TPS conducts online information sessions to help students understand their options and the assistance available to them ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n*   **Educational Institutions:** Many institutions offer dedicated support services for international students, including academic advising, counseling, and assistance with visa-related matters.\n\n## Recent Changes Affecting International Students in 2025\n\nSeveral policy changes have been introduced in 2025 that affect international students in Australia. These changes aim to enhance the quality of education, prevent unethical practices, and strengthen the integrity of the international education system ([IELTS IDP India, 2024](https://ieltsidpindia.com/blog/australia-new-updates-for-international-students-in-2025)).\n\n### 1. Enrollment Caps\n\nThe Australian government has implemented caps on the number of international students that each institution can enroll. Public universities are set to enroll around 145,000 new international students in 2025, maintaining the same intake as in 2023 ([International BAATE, 2024](https://internationalbaate.com/australia-new-limit-international-students/)). The Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector will admit approximately 95,000 new students ([International BAATE, 2024](https://internationalbaate.com/australia-new-limit-international-students/)). Other universities and non-university education providers will have their intake capped at 30,000 students ([International BAATE, 2024](https://internationalbaate.com/australia-new-limit-international-students/)). These caps may affect the availability of places in alternative courses for students whose schools have closed.\n\n### 2. Stricter Visa Requirements\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, the Department of Home Affairs will not accept offer letters alone for student visa applications. Onshore applicants are required to include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) at the time of application ([AIMS Education, n.d.](https://www.aims-education.com/australian-student-visa-new-rules/)). This change is intended to ensure that only genuine students are granted visas.\n\n### 3. Increased English Language Requirements\n\nThe English language requirements for Australian student visas have been increased, effective from March 2024 ([AIMS Education, n.d.](https://www.aims-education.com/australian-student-visa-new-rules/)). The minimum IELTS score for a student visa has increased from 5.5 to 6.0. For ELICOS courses, the requirement has increased from 4.5 to 5.5, and for Foundation/Pathway Programs, it has increased from 5 to 5.5 ([AIMS Education, n.d.](https://www.aims-education.com/australian-student-visa-new-rules/)). These changes may pose additional challenges for some students seeking to transfer to a new course.\n\n### 4. Tuition Protection Service (TPS) Levies\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is funded through levies on education providers. The Department of Education conducts regular consultations on the levies for both domestic and international students ([Department of Education, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/tps)). These levies ensure that the TPS has the resources to support students in the event of a provider default.\n\n## Steps for Students to Take\n\nGiven these potential outcomes and recent policy changes, international students affected by a school closure should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Contact the TPS:** Immediately contact the TPS to understand the available options and assistance ([IMC, n.d.](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/fees/tuition-protection-service/)).\n2.  **Seek Support from Education Agents:** Education agents can provide valuable guidance in finding a new course and navigating the visa process ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n3.  **Gather Academic Records:** Collect all necessary documentation from the closed school, including academic transcripts and certificates ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n4.  **Enroll in a New Course:** Enroll in a new course with a registered provider as soon as possible to maintain visa status ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n5.  **Update Visa Details:** Update visa details via ImmiAccount to reflect the new provider and course details ([Pathway to Aus, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n6.  **Monitor Visa Validity:** Keep track of the visa\u2019s expiration date and avoid letting the status lapse ([Visa Verge, 2024](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe closure of a school presents significant challenges for international students in Australia. However, the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) and other support systems are in place to assist students in finding alternative educational arrangements and maintaining their visa status. Recent policy changes, including enrollment caps and stricter visa requirements, may add complexity to the process. Affected students must take prompt action, seek support from relevant services, and ensure they comply with all visa requirements to minimize disruption to their studies. By staying informed and proactive, international students can navigate these challenges and continue their educational journey in Australia.\n\n## References\n\nAIMS Education.

      "full_response": "# The Tuition Protection Service in Australia: A Detailed Overview\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) in Australia is a crucial mechanism designed to safeguard the interests of international and domestic students in the event of education provider defaults. This report will provide a detailed overview of the TPS, focusing on its legislative basis, functions, governance, and the protections it offers to students. The report will also examine the funding model of the TPS and recent consultations regarding tuition protection levies.\n\n## Legislative Basis of the Tuition Protection Service\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service is primarily outlined in the [Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx) (ESOS Act) and related legislation ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)). The ESOS Act establishes the legal framework governing the delivery of education to overseas students studying in Australia on a student visa. It ensures that training providers meet nationally consistent standards in education delivery, facilities, and services, and provides tuition fee protection for international students ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n\nThe TPS was established in 2012 as an international student tuition protection scheme under the ESOS Act ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)). Subsequent amendments and expansions have broadened the scope of the TPS to include specific domestic student cohorts. These expansions occurred in 2020 under the [VET Student Loans Act 2016](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps) and the [Higher Education Support Act 2003](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps), and in 2021 under the [Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps) ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\n### Key Legislation\n\nSeveral key pieces of legislation underpin the operation of the TPS:\n\n*   **Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act):** This Act governs the registration process and obligations of registered providers, the Tuition Protection Service, and enforcement and compliance powers ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n*   **Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Act 2012:** This Act amended the ESOS Act to establish the TPS ([Federal Register of Legislation, n.d.](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00181)).\n*   **Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012:** This Act provides for the imposition of levies to fund the TPS ([International Education, n.d.a](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).*   **VET Student Loans Act 2016:** This Act expanded the TPS to include domestic Vocational Education and Training (VET) students receiving VET Student Loan (VSL) assistance ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   **Higher Education Support Act 2003:** This Act further expanded the TPS to include domestic higher education students receiving FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP loan assistance ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   **Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011:** This Act contributed to the expansion of the TPS to provide tuition protection for specific domestic student cohorts ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   **VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020:** This Act pertains to the VSL tuition protection levy ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   **Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020:** This Act relates to the HELP tuition protection levy ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   **Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020:** This Act concerns the up-front payments tuition protection levy ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\n## Functions and Student Cohorts Supported by the TPS\n\nThe TPS supports four student cohorts enrolled at private education providers ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)):\n\n1.  International students on student visas.\n2.  Domestic Vocational Education and Training (VET) students receiving VET Student Loan (VSL) assistance.\n3.  Domestic higher education students receiving FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP loan assistance.\n4.  Domestic higher education students who pay their tuition fees up-front.\n\nFollowing a provider default, the TPS ensures that these students can either:\n\n*   Complete their studies at another education provider ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   Receive a refund of the tuition fees paid up-front for the affected unit(s) of study ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n*   Receive a loan re-credit for the loan amount used to pay tuition fees for the affected unit(s) of study ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\nThe TPS aims to provide a flexible and streamlined approach to student placement and refund arrangements in the event a defaulting provider does not meet its refund obligations under the ESOS Act ([University of Technology Sydney, n.d.](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities/tuition-protection-service)).\n\n## Governance and Management of the TPS\n\nThe TPS is managed by the TPS Director, a statutory position created under Commonwealth legislation ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)). The TPS Director is responsible for the delivery and maintenance of the long-term sustainability of the Service. As of the current date (March 3, 2025), the TPS Director is Ms. Melinda Hatton ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\nThe TPS Director is also the VSL Tuition Protection Director under the VET Student Loans Act 2016 and the Higher Education Tuition Protection Director under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\n### TPS Advisory Board\n\nThe TPS Director is supported by the [TPS Advisory Board](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps). The Board is required, by legislation, to consist of six Commonwealth members and up to seven independent members. The Board\u2019s function is to provide advice and make recommendations to the TPS Director on the settings of the TPS levies ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\n## Tuition Protection Levies\n\nThe TPS is sector and Commonwealth funded ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)). Education providers pay one or more annual sector-based tuition protection levies commensurate with their size and risk of defaulting. The levies are held in sector-based quarantined accounts and are used to fund the activities of the TPS following a default ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\nThe four levies collected by the TPS annually are the ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)):\n\n1.  International TPS levy\n2.  VSL tuition protection levy\n3.  HELP tuition protection levy\n4.  Up-front payments tuition protection levy\n\nAnnual levy settings are determined in legislative instruments made under the following Acts ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.b](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)):\n\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012\n*   VET Student Loans (VSL Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020\n*   Higher Education Support (HELP Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020\n*   Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Act 2020\n\n### Recent Levy Consultations\n\nThe TPS conducts regular consultations on the tuition protection levies. For example, in February 2025, the TPS conducted sector consultation on the draft 2025 VSL, HELP, and Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy settings ([Department of Education, Australian Government, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/announcements/2025-domestic-tuition-protection-levies-consultation)). The TPS Advisory Board provided its draft advice on the 2025 Domestic Tuition Protection Levy settings to the TPS Director at the February 2025 Board meeting ([Department of Education, Australian Government, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/announcements/2025-domestic-tuition-protection-levies-consultation)).\n\n## TPS Online\n\n[TPS Online](https://www.education.gov.au/tps) is the case management system students use to receive assistance from the TPS following an education provider default. TPS Online is also used by alternative providers identified by the TPS ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.c](https://www.education.gov.au/tps)). Through TPS Online, students can access information about alternative course options and submit required documents to facilitate refunds of unspent tuition fees ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.f](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-students)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service is a critical component of the Australian education system, providing essential protections for both international and domestic students. The TPS, underpinned by the ESOS Act and related legislation, ensures that students are not left without options in the event of an education provider default. Through its comprehensive framework, the TPS supports students in continuing their studies or receiving appropriate refunds or loan re-credits. The ongoing consultations and adjustments to tuition protection levies demonstrate the Australian Government's commitment to maintaining a robust and sustainable tuition protection system.\n\n## References\n\nDepartment of Education, Australian Government.

      "full_response": "## Applying for an Australian Student Visa: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nAustralia has long been a popular destination for international students seeking quality education and a vibrant cultural experience ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)). To facilitate this, the Australian government offers the Student Visa (Subclass 500), which allows eligible individuals to study full-time at registered Australian educational institutions ([Law and Visas, n.d.](https://lawandvisas.com/australia-student-visa/)). As of January 1, 2025, significant changes to the student visa application process have been implemented, primarily focusing on the mandatory requirement of a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). This report aims to provide a comprehensive guide to applying for an Australian student visa, taking into account these recent updates and outlining the key steps involved.\n\n**Opinion:** Based on the information available, the primary place to apply for an Australian student visa is through the Department of Home Affairs' ImmiAccount online portal. While educational institutions and migration agents can assist with the application process, the official submission and management of the visa application are conducted via ImmiAccount.\n\n### The ImmiAccount Portal: The Primary Application Platform\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs utilizes the ImmiAccount portal as the central platform for managing visa applications, including the Student Visa (Subclass 500) ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)). This online system allows applicants to:\n\n*   Create an account and initiate the application process ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/australian-student-visa-subclass-500-requirements-application/)).\n*   Complete the online application form, providing all necessary information ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   Upload required documents, such as the CoE, proof of financial capacity, and English language proficiency test scores ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)).\n*   Pay the visa application fee ([VisaGuide.World, n.d.](https://visaguide.world/australia-visa/study/student-visa-500/)). As of July 2024, the fee is AUD 1,600 ([Travel and Tour World, 2025](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/australia-requires-confirmation-of-enrolment-for-all-student-visas-in-2025/)).\n*   Track the application's progress ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\nThe ImmiAccount portal streamlines the application process, providing a centralized and accessible platform for both applicants and the Department of Home Affairs.\n\n### Key Steps in the Student Visa Application Process\n\nThe process of applying for an Australian student visa involves several crucial steps, each requiring careful attention to detail:\n\n1.  **Choose a Course and Institution:** The initial step is to select a course of study and an educational institution registered with the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)). CRICOS registration ensures that the institution and its courses meet the required standards for international students ([Immiplace, n.d.](https://immiplace.com/countries/australia/australia-student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n\n2.  **Obtain a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is mandatory for all student visa applications ([Vino Education Consulting, 2025](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)). To obtain a CoE, students must:\n\n    *   Apply to the chosen university or college.\n    *   Accept the offer of admission.\n    *   Pay the required tuition fees ([Travel and Tour World, 2025](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/australia-requires-confirmation-of-enrolment-for-all-student-visas-in-2025/)).\n\n    The CoE serves as official confirmation of enrollment and is a critical document for the visa application ([Visa and Immigrations, n.d.](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n3.  **Gather Required Documents:** A comprehensive set of documents is required to support the visa application. These typically include:\n\n    *   Passport (valid for the duration of the stay) ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n    *   Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)).\n    *   Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) statement, outlining the applicant's intention to study in Australia temporarily and return home upon completion ([Law and Visas, n.d.](https://lawandvisas.com/australia-student-visa/)).\n    *   Proof of financial capacity, demonstrating sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses (at least AUD 29,710), and travel costs ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)).\n    *   Evidence of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of the stay ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)).\n    *   English language proficiency test scores (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic) ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)).\n    *   Academic transcripts and certificates ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n    *   Police clearance certificate (if applicable) ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n    *   Recent passport-sized photographs ([VisaGuide.World, n.d.](https://visaguide.world/australia-visa/study/student-visa-500/)).\n\n    All documents must be in English or accompanied by certified English translations ([VisaGuide.World, n.d.](https://visaguide.world/australia-visa/study/student-visa-500/)).\n\n4.  **Apply Online via ImmiAccount:** Once all required documents are gathered, the application is submitted online through the ImmiAccount portal ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)). The application form must be completed accurately and truthfully, and all supporting documents must be uploaded ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)).\n\n5.  **Pay the Visa Application Fee:** The visa application fee must be paid online through ImmiAccount ([VisaGuide.World, n.d.](https://visaguide.world/australia-visa/study/student-visa-500/)). As of July 2024, the fee is AUD 1,600 ([Travel and Tour World, 2025](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/australia-requires-confirmation-of-enrolment-for-all-student-visas-in-2025/)).\n\n6.  **Undergo Health Check and Provide Biometrics (If Required):** After submitting the application, applicants may be required to undergo a health examination by an approved panel physician and provide biometrics (photographs and fingerprints) ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n7.  **Attend an Interview (If Required):** In some cases, applicants may be asked to attend a visa interview to discuss their reasons for choosing Australia and their study plans ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n8.  **Wait for Visa Decision:** The processing time for a Student Visa (Subclass 500) can vary, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)). Applicants can track their application status through their ImmiAccount ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** Applicants must demonstrate sufficient English language proficiency through recognized tests such as IELTS, TOEFL, or PTE Academic ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/how-to-apply-for-an-australia-student-visa/)). Certain exemptions may apply to students from specific countries or those who have completed previous studies in English ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/australian-student-visa-subclass-500-requirements-application/)).\n\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) Requirement:** The GTE requirement assesses the applicant's intention to stay in Australia temporarily for study purposes ([Law and Visas, n.d.](https://lawandvisas.com/australia-student-visa/)). Applicants must provide a statement outlining their reasons for choosing the course and Australia as their study destination, how they will benefit from the course, and their plans after completing their studies ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)).\n\n*   **Financial Capacity:** Applicants must provide evidence of sufficient funds to cover their tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)). This can be demonstrated through bank statements, sponsorship letters, or other financial documents ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Working While Studying:** Student visa holders are generally permitted to work part-time in Australia, up to 48 hours per fortnight during the semester and full-time during breaks ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Post-Study Options:** Australia offers various pathways for international students to gain work experience or pursue permanent residency after graduation, such as the Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) and the Skilled Migration Program ([Australia Unwrapped, n.d.](https://www.australiaunwrapped.com/student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nApplying for an Australian student visa requires careful planning and adherence to the outlined procedures. The ImmiAccount portal serves as the primary platform for submitting and managing the application. The mandatory CoE requirement, effective from January 1, 2025, underscores the importance of securing enrollment in a registered course and paying tuition fees upfront. By understanding the key steps, gathering the necessary documents, and meeting the eligibility criteria, international students can navigate the application process successfully and embark on their educational journey in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nAdmission Ac Blog.

      "full_response": "## Report on Australian Student Visa Requirements\n\nThe Australian Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has implemented several changes to the student visa application process, particularly with effect from January 1, 2025, and March 23, 2024, aimed at ensuring the integrity of the visa system and attracting genuine students ([VisaGuide.News](https://visaguide.world/news/australia-imposes-stricter-student-visa-requirements/)). These changes include revised financial requirements, increased English proficiency standards, and a shift from the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) to the Genuine Student (GS) requirement ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/new-genuine-student-requirement)). A key modification is the mandatory submission of a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for onshore applications, replacing the previously accepted Letter of Offer ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). This report aims to identify which of the listed items is *never* required by DHA for an individual to obtain a student visa, based on the provided information.\n\n### Key Changes to Australian Student Visa Requirements\n\nTo understand what is *never* required, it is crucial to first outline what *is* required. The DHA has made significant adjustments to several aspects of the student visa process.\n\n#### 1. Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)As of January 1, 2025, a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is mandatory for all onshore student visa applications ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). This document, issued by the educational institution, confirms the applicant's place in a registered course. The DHA no longer accepts Letters of Offer for onshore applications lodged after this date ([vinoeducationconsulting.com](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n\n#### 2. Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement, effective from March 23, 2024, replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/new-genuine-student-requirement)). This assessment evaluates the applicant's intention to study in Australia, their reasons for choosing the course and Australia, and the potential benefits of the course to their future ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/gte-to-study-in-australia/)). The GS requirement involves answering targeted questions about the applicant's circumstances, study plans, and ties to their home country ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/new-genuine-student-requirement)).\n\n#### 3. English Language Proficiency\n\nThe minimum English language proficiency scores have increased. As of March 23, 2024, the minimum IELTS score for a student visa is 6.0 (or equivalent), up from 5.5 ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/english-language-requirements-changes)). For a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485), the required IELTS score is 6.5 ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\n#### 4. Financial Capacity\n\nApplicants must demonstrate sufficient financial capacity to cover travel costs, living expenses, and course fees for at least 12 months ([ausimmi.com.au](https://ausimmi.com.au/student-visa-financial-requirements/)). Acceptable evidence includes deposits of money, government or financial institution loans, scholarships, or the annual income of a parent or partner ([ausimmi.com.au](https://ausimmi.com.au/student-visa-financial-requirements/)). As of 2025, the 12-month living costs are AUD 29,710 for students, AUD 10,394 for partners, and AUD 4,449 for children ([ausimmi.com.au](https://ausimmi.com.au/student-visa-financial-requirements/)).\n\n### Identifying What is *Never* RequiredBased on the provided information, a **Letter of Offer** is *never* required for onshore student visa applications lodged on or after January 1, 2025 ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). The DHA has explicitly stated that a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) must be provided instead ([visaguide.world](https://visaguide.world/news/australia-imposes-stricter-student-visa-requirements/)).### Analysis and Justification\n\nThe shift from accepting a Letter of Offer to requiring a CoE is a significant change. A Letter of Offer is a preliminary document indicating that an educational institution is willing to offer a place to a student, contingent on meeting certain conditions ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). A CoE, on the other hand, is issued only after the student has accepted the offer and paid the necessary tuition fees ([studyabroad.careers360.com](https://studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/australian-student-visa-new-rules-2025-for-indian-students)).\n\nThis change aims to ensure that only genuine students who have made a financial commitment to their education are granted visas ([visaguide.world](https://visaguide.world/news/australia-imposes-stricter-student-visa-requirements/)). It reduces the likelihood of individuals using student visas as a means to enter Australia without the intention of pursuing studies ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\n### Exceptions and Considerations\n\nIt is important to note that applications lodged *before* January 1, 2025, with a Letter of Offer remain unaffected ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). Additionally, certain categories of students, such as Defence or Secondary Exchange Students and students sponsored by Foreign Affairs, may have different evidence requirements ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/02/australia-to-mandate-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-student-visas-from-january-2025/)).\n\n### Implications for Students\n\nThe new CoE requirement has several implications for students:\n\n1.  **Financial Planning:** Students must be prepared to pay tuition fees upfront to obtain a CoE ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). This, combined with the AUD 1,600 visa fee, necessitates careful financial planning ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n2.  **Early Application:** Students should start the application process early to secure their CoE in time ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n3.  **Visa Validity:** Current visa holders must obtain a CoE before their visa expires or explore alternative visa options ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/02/australia-to-mandate-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-student-visas-from-january-2025/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, for onshore student visa applications lodged on or after January 1, 2025, a **Letter of Offer** is *never* required by the DHA. The mandatory requirement is now a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), reflecting the DHA's efforts to strengthen the integrity of the student visa system and ensure that only genuine students benefit from Australia's education opportunities ([visaguide.world](https://visaguide.world/news/australia-imposes-stricter-student-visa-requirements/)). This change necessitates careful planning and financial preparation for international students seeking to study in Australia ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### References\n\n*   Admission Ac Blog.

      "full_response": "# A Detailed Report on DHA's Evidentiary Requirements for Australian Student Visas Based on Country Risk Levels\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) in Australia employs a risk-based framework to assess student visa applications, tailoring evidentiary requirements based on the applicant's country of origin and the education provider's risk level. This approach aims to streamline the visa process for genuine students while mitigating the risk of non-compliance and fraud. This report delves into the specifics of this framework, examining how risk levels are determined, the implications for students from different countries, and the recent changes implemented to enhance the integrity of the international education sector.\n\n## The Risk-Based Framework: An Overview\n\nAustralia's student visa system operates under the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF), which assigns risk levels to both educational institutions and countries ([Educonnect, n.d.](https://www.educonnect.com.au/blog/56-risk-levels-for-students-and-institutions-what-is-it)). These risk levels dictate the level of documentation required from applicants regarding their financial capacity and English proficiency. The framework is designed to prioritize visa processing for low-risk applicants, allowing the DHA to focus resources on higher-risk cases ([Packer, 2023](https://thepienews.com/australia-visas-prioritised-by-provider-risk-under-new-directive/)).\n\n### Determining Risk Levels\n\nThe DHA assesses the risk level of educational providers based on several factors, including:\n\n*   Rate of visa cancellations (25% weighting) ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n*   Rate of refusals due to fraud (40% weighting) ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n*   Rate of refusals (excluding fraud) (10% weighting) ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n*   Rate of student visa holders becoming unlawful non-citizens (15% weighting) ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n*   Rate of Subsequent Protection Visa applications (10% weighting) ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n\nCountries are also assigned risk levels based on historical visa outcomes, including refusal rates and the incidence of non-genuine applicants ([Educonnect, n.d.](https://www.educonnect.com.au/blog/56-risk-levels-for-students-and-institutions-what-is-it)).\n\n### Evidence Levels\n\nThe SSVF categorizes educational providers into three evidence levels:\n\n*   **Evidence Level 1 (Low Risk):** Applicants from these institutions typically do not need to provide extensive proof of financial capacity or English proficiency unless specifically requested ([Educonnect, n.d.](https://www.educonnect.com.au/blog/56-risk-levels-for-students-and-institutions-what-is-it)).\n*   **Evidence Level 2 (Moderate Risk):** These applicants may need to provide more documentation to support their visa application ([Educonnect, n.d.](https://www.educonnect.com.au/blog/56-risk-levels-for-students-and-institutions-what-is-it)).\n*   **Evidence Level 3 (High Risk):** Applicants from these institutions face the most stringent documentation requirements ([Educonnect, n.d.](https://www.educonnect.com.au/blog/56-risk-levels-for-students-and-institutions-what-is-it)).\n\nThese levels are reassessed twice a year, in March and September, based on the preceding 12-month period ([ICEF Monitor, 2024](https://monitor.icef.com/2024/02/australian-unis-brace-for-risk-assessment-as-visa-rejections-continue/)).\n\n## Implications for Students from Different Countries\n\nThe risk level assigned to a student's country of origin significantly impacts the evidentiary requirements they must meet. Students from countries deemed \"high risk\" face more rigorous scrutiny and must provide more extensive documentation to demonstrate their genuine intention to study and their financial capacity ([Visa Envoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/risk-level-changes-to-student-visas/)).\n\n### Financial Capacity\n\nStudents from higher-risk countries must provide substantial evidence of their financial capacity to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)). This may include:\n\n*   Bank statements demonstrating sufficient funds for the duration of their stay ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)). As per Australian immigration guidelines, students should have access to at least AUD 21,041 per year to cover living costs ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)). However, PFEC Global states that students need to show AUD 29,710 in savings per year to cover living costs ([PFEC Global, n.d.](https://pfecglobal.com.bd/visa-requirements-for-studying-in-australia/)).\n*   Evidence of financial sponsorship, including bank statements or financial documents of the sponsor ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)).\n*   Loan approval documents or financial aid notifications ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)).\n*   Income tax returns and bank statements ([Leverage Edu, n.d.](https://leverageedu.com/learn/documents-required-for-student-visa-australia/)).\n\nIn some cases, students may need to demonstrate that their parents or spouse have an annual income of at least AUD 60,000 for single students or AUD 70,000 for students accompanied by family members ([Visa Envoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/risk-level-changes-to-student-visas/)).\n\n### Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nThe DHA assesses the genuineness of a student's intention to study in Australia through the Genuine Student (GS) requirement, which replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement on March 23, 2024 ([Care Insurance, 2024](https://www.careinsurance.com/blog/travel-insurance-articles/australia-s-new-genuine-student-requirements-gsr); [Degree Scope, n.d.](https://degreescope.com/australian-student-visa-the-genuine-student-gs-requirement/)). The GS requirement aims to ensure that students are genuinely committed to their education and plan to return to their home country after completing their studies ([College Dunia, n.d.](https://collegedunia.com/australia/article/gs-requirement-in-australia)).\n\nThe GS assessment considers various factors, including:\n\n*   **Circumstances in the home country:** This includes ties to family, community, employment, and economic circumstances ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/new-genuine-student-requirement); [Care Insurance, 2024](https://www.careinsurance.com/blog/travel-insurance-articles/australia-s-new-genuine-student-requirements-gsr)). Applicants must explain why they are not pursuing a similar course in their home country and provide details of their connections to their country of origin ([College Dunia, n.d.](https://collegedunia.com/australia/article/gs-requirement-in-australia)).\n*   **Reasons for studying the chosen course:** Applicants must explain why they wish to study their desired course, demonstrating an understanding of the study and living requirements ([Navitas, n.d.](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/)).\n*   **Value of the chosen course:** Applicants must articulate how the course will benefit them and their career aspirations ([Navitas, n.d.](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/); [Care Insurance, 2024](https://www.careinsurance.com/blog/travel-insurance-articles/australia-s-new-genuine-student-requirements-gsr)).\n*   **Immigration history:** Applicants must disclose their previous visa applications and any visa refusals from any country ([Navitas, n.d.](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/)).\n*   **Level of knowledge:** DHA assesses the level of knowledge of the proposed course and education provider, as well as the level of research undertaken into the proposed course of study and living arrangements ([College Dunia, n.d.](https://collegedunia.com/australia/article/gs-requirement-in-australia)).\n\nTo meet the GS requirement, applicants must provide detailed information and supporting documents, including academic transcripts, employment information, and proof of ties to their home country ([College Dunia, n.d.](https://collegedunia.com/australia/article/gs-requirement-in-australia)). They must also demonstrate a clear intention to return to their home country after completing their studies ([College Dunia, n.d.](https://collegedunia.com/australia/article/gs-requirement-in-australia)).\n\n### English Language Proficiency\n\nAll international students, except those exempt (e.g., citizens of certain English-speaking countries), must demonstrate English language proficiency ([Immigration News Australia, n.d.](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). Accepted tests include IELTS, TOEFL, and PTE ([AECC Global, n.d.](https://www.aeccglobal.com.np/blog/australia-student-visa-requirements)). The minimum scores required vary depending on the university and course, but generally, a score of 6 on the IELTS is required ([PFEC Global, n.d.](https://pfecglobal.com.bd/visa-requirements-for-studying-in-australia/)).\n\n## Recent Changes and Their Impact\n\nSeveral recent changes to Australia's student visa system have impacted evidentiary requirements and visa processing:\n\n*   **Replacement of GTE with GS:** The shift from the GTE to the GS requirement on March 23, 2024, signifies a renewed focus on assessing the genuineness of students' intentions ([Care Insurance, 2024](https://www.careinsurance.com/blog/travel-insurance-articles/australia-s-new-genuine-student-requirements-gsr); [Degree Scope, n.d.](https://degreescope.com/australian-student-visa-the-genuine-student-gs-requirement/)). The GS requirement involves a more detailed assessment of the applicant's circumstances and motivations for studying in Australia ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/new-genuine-student-requirement)).\n*   **Prioritization of visa applications based on provider risk:** The DHA prioritizes visa applications from students attending education providers with lower risk levels ([Packer, 2023](https://thepienews.com/australia-visas-prioritised-by-provider-risk-under-new-directive/)). This means that students attending higher-risk institutions may experience longer processing times and face greater scrutiny.\n*   **Increased scrutiny of high-risk countries:** Students from countries deemed \"high risk\" face more rigorous scrutiny and must provide more extensive documentation to demonstrate their genuine intention to study and their financial capacity ([Visa Envoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/risk-level-changes-to-student-visas/)).\n\nThese changes reflect the Australian government's commitment to maintaining the integrity of its international education sector and ensuring that only genuine students are granted visas ([Degree Scope, n.d.](https://degreescope.com/australian-student-visa-the-genuine-student-gs-requirement/)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DHA's evidentiary requirements for student visas are tailored based on the applicant's country of origin and the education provider's risk level. Students from higher-risk countries and institutions face more stringent documentation requirements and greater scrutiny to ensure they are genuine students with the financial capacity to support their studies. Recent changes, such as the replacement of the GTE with the GS requirement and the prioritization of visa applications based on provider risk, reflect the Australian government's ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity of its international education sector. As of March 3, 2025, these measures are in full effect, influencing the application process for prospective international students.\n\n## References\n\nAECC Global.

      "full_response": "## Report on International Student's Ability to Study Part-Time in Australia on a Student Visa (Subclass 500)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the query regarding an international student in Australia holding a Student Visa (Subclass 500) who wishes to change from full-time to part-time study in a Bachelor of Engineering program. It will analyze the relevant regulations and guidelines to determine the student's options and the potential implications of such a change, considering the updates to the Australian student visa system in 2025. The report will provide a comprehensive overview of the conditions and restrictions associated with the Subclass 500 visa, focusing on study load requirements and potential pathways for the student.\n\n**Overview of the Student Visa (Subclass 500)**\n\nThe Student Visa (Subclass 500) is designed for international students who intend to study full-time at a registered Australian educational institution ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). This visa allows students to pursue a wide range of courses, including English language programs, vocational education and training (VET), higher education degrees, and postgraduate research ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)). It also provides certain flexibilities, such as the ability to include eligible family members and the opportunity to work part-time ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n**Core Requirements and Restrictions**\n\nSeveral conditions must be met to maintain compliance with the Subclass 500 visa. These include:\n\n*   **Enrolment:** Maintaining enrolment in a CRICOS-registered course ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Satisfactory Attendance and Progress:** Meeting the academic performance and attendance requirements of the course ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Work Limitations:** Adhering to the work hour limitations, which generally allow up to 48 hours per fortnight during study periods ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Health Insurance:** Maintaining valid Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) throughout the stay ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Update Details:** Notifying the educational institution and the Department of Home Affairs of any changes to address or circumstances ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\nFailure to comply with these conditions may result in visa cancellation ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n**The Possibility of Part-Time Study**\n\nGenerally, international students on a student visa are required to maintain a full-time study load ([The University of Queensland, n.d.](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1924/~/as-an-international-student,-can-i-study-part-time?)). However, there are specific circumstances under which a reduced study load or part-time study may be permitted ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n\n**Circumstances Allowing Reduced Study Load**\n\n1.  **Approved Reduced Study Load:** Part-time study may be possible if the student has been approved by their faculty for a reduced study load ([The University of Queensland, n.d.](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1924/~/as-an-international-student,-can-i-study-part-time?)). This typically requires demonstrating compelling reasons, such as changes in personal circumstances ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n2.  **Specific Circumstances:** Some universities allow a reduced load in specific circumstances, particularly if the student experiences a short-term change in personal circumstances ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n3.  **Compassionate or Compelling Reasons:** A Leave of Absence or reduced study load may be approved for compassionate or compelling reasons, which would require a new Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([The University of Melbourne, n.d.](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-support/international-student-support/visas/international-student-visa-and-study-entitlements)).\n\n**Steps the Student Can Take**\n\nGiven the student's difficulty with their Bachelor of Engineering program, they should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Consult with the University:** The student should first consult with their course coordinator or academic advisor to discuss their difficulties and explore options for support ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n2.  **Apply for a Reduced Study Load:** If the university deems it appropriate, the student can apply for a reduced study load. This will likely require providing evidence of the difficulties they are facing and demonstrating that they have a plan to manage their studies effectively ([The University of Queensland, n.d.](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1924/~/as-an-international-student,-can-i-study-part-time?)).\n3.  **Contact a Compliance Officer:** The student can speak with a compliance officer at their university to understand the implications of changing their study load on their visa ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n4.  **Check Visa Conditions:** The student should check their visa conditions using the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) system to understand any restrictions or requirements related to their study load ([The University of Melbourne, n.d.](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-support/international-student-support/visas/international-student-visa-and-study-entitlements)).\n5.  **Ensure Compliance:** If a reduced study load is approved, the student must ensure they continue to meet all other visa conditions, such as maintaining satisfactory attendance and progress in their course ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n**Potential Implications and Considerations**\n\n*   **Visa Validity:** Reducing the study load may affect the duration of the student's visa. If the course duration is extended due to part-time study, the student may need to apply for a new student visa ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)).\n*   **Course Completion:** The student must complete their course within the expected duration specified on their CoE, unless an extension is granted for compelling reasons ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Financial Aid:** Reducing the enrolment load can affect eligibility for government assistance such as Youth Allowance, Austudy, and Abstudy (though these are typically for domestic students) ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/change-study-load.html)).\n*   **Work Rights:** The student's work rights remain the same, with a limit of 48 hours per fortnight during study periods ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n**Recent Changes and Updates in 2025**\n\nSeveral changes to the Australian student visa system have been implemented in 2025, which may affect the student's situation:\n\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, all student visa applications, including those lodged onshore, must include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([Visa and Immigrations, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **National Planning Level (NPL) Cap:** A cap of 270,000 new international student commencements has been introduced for 2025, which aims to manage the growth of the international education sector ([Visa and Immigrations, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **Stricter Guidelines:** The student visa process has become stricter, with increased financial costs and limitations on onshore applications ([Visa Verge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\nThese changes emphasize the importance of early preparation and compliance with visa requirements.\n\n**Changing Courses or Institutions**\n\nIt's important to note that if the student is considering changing courses or institutions, additional requirements apply. If the student has been studying for less than six months at their current institution, they must obtain a release letter from that institution before transferring ([Visa Verge, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/understanding-study-rights-on-your-australian-visa/)). Additionally, changing to a lower-level course may require applying for a new student visa ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, while it is generally expected that international students on a Subclass 500 visa maintain a full-time study load, the student in question may be able to study part-time if they can demonstrate compelling reasons and obtain approval from their university. The student should consult with their course coordinator, apply for a reduced study load, and contact a compliance officer to understand the implications for their visa. They should also check their visa conditions using VEVO and ensure they continue to meet all other visa requirements. The recent changes to the student visa system in 2025 emphasize the importance of compliance and early preparation. If the student is considering changing courses or institutions, they should be aware of the additional requirements and potential impact on their visa.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nIt is recommended that the student proactively engage with their university's support services and visa compliance officers to navigate the process of potentially reducing their study load. Additionally, they should meticulously document all communications and approvals to ensure compliance with visa regulations.\n\n**References**\n\nKangaroo Edu.

      "full_response": "## Report on Student Visa Compliance and Attendance Requirements in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the scenario of an international student enrolled in a Foundation Year Program in Australia who has been absent from classes for two weeks. The student is currently holding a student visa. The report will outline the institution's responsibilities and the steps it should take to ensure compliance with Australian student visa regulations, particularly concerning attendance monitoring and reporting obligations. The report will also consider potential consequences for the student and the institution.\n\n**Institution's Responsibilities: Attendance Monitoring and Reporting**\n\nAustralian education providers have a legal and ethical responsibility to monitor the attendance of international students holding student visas ([Department of Home Affairs](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/maintaining-your-australian-student-visa-attendance-requirements/)). This responsibility stems from the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 and the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code) ([National Code 2018](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)). Standard 11 of the National Code specifically addresses monitoring student attendance.\n\n**Key Requirements for Attendance Monitoring**\n\n*   **Documented Policies and Procedures:** Institutions must have clearly documented policies and procedures for monitoring attendance for each course requiring attendance monitoring ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)). These policies should outline the requirements for achieving satisfactory attendance, the method for recording attendance and absences, the process for assessing satisfactory attendance, the point at which a student is deemed to have failed to meet satisfactory attendance, and the procedure for notifying students of their attendance status ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n*   **Minimum Attendance Requirement:** While the specific attendance benchmark can vary, institutions generally require students to attend at least 80% of their scheduled classes ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/maintaining-your-australian-student-visa-attendance-requirements/)). The institution's policy should clearly state the minimum attendance requirement for the Foundation Year Program.\n\n*   **Regular Assessment:** Institutions must regularly assess student attendance in accordance with their documented policies and procedures ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n**Steps the Institution Should Take**\n\nGiven the student's two-week absence, the institution should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Review Attendance Records:** Immediately review the student's attendance records to confirm the duration and extent of the absence.\n\n2.  **Contact the Student:** Attempt to contact the student to determine the reason for their absence. This could involve phone calls, emails, or text messages. It is crucial to document all attempts to contact the student.\n\n3.  **Counselling and Support:** If contact is established, offer the student counselling and support services. Explore the reasons for their absence and identify any challenges they may be facing. This could include academic difficulties, personal issues, or health concerns ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/maintaining-your-australian-student-visa-attendance-requirements/)).\n\n4.  **Formal Warning:** If the student's attendance has fallen below the required level (as defined in the institution's policy), issue a formal written warning. This warning should clearly state that the student has breached their visa condition related to attendance and that their visa may be at risk of cancellation ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n5.  **Notice of Intention to Report (NOIR):** If the student's attendance continues to be unsatisfactory and there is no possibility of them reaching the required level by the end of the study period, the institution must issue a Notice of Intention to Report (NOIR) to the student ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n    *   The NOIR must be in writing and clearly state that the student has breached their visa condition in relation to attendance requirements ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n    *   The NOIR must inform the student of their right to access the institution's complaints and appeals process and that they have 20 working days to do so ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n6.  **Complaints and Appeals Process:** If the student accesses the institution's complaints and appeals process, the institution must follow its documented procedures for handling such appeals. The institution should not report the student until the process is completed and the decision supports the institution, or the student has not accessed the process within 20 working days ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n7.  **Reporting to the Department of Home Affairs:** If the complaints and appeals process results in a decision supporting the institution, or the student does not access the process within the specified timeframe, the institution must report the student to the Department of Home Affairs through the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n8.  **Record Keeping:** Maintain detailed records of all communication with the student, warnings issued, and actions taken. This documentation is crucial for demonstrating compliance with ESOS regulations.\n\n**Exceptions to Reporting**\n\nIn certain circumstances, the institution may choose not to report the student for breaching the 80% attendance requirement. According to the National Code, this is permissible for VET, ELICOS, non-award, or school courses if:\n\n*   The decision not to report is consistent with the institution's attendance policies and procedures.\n*   The student is attending at least 70% of scheduled course contact hours.\n*   The student's course progress is satisfactory (VET and non-award courses) or compassionate or compelling circumstances apply (ELICOS and school courses) ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\nSince the student is enrolled in a Foundation Year Program, the institution may consider compassionate or compelling circumstances when deciding whether to report the student. However, if the student's attendance falls below 70%, the institution must issue a NOIR ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\n*   **For the Student:** If the institution reports the student to the Department of Home Affairs for unsatisfactory attendance, the Department may consider cancelling the student's visa ([Parish Patience](https://www.parishpatience.com.au/student-visa-cancellation-consequences-australia/)). Visa cancellation can have severe consequences, including the requirement to leave Australia, a potential three-year ban from re-entering the country, and significant financial loss ([Parish Patience](https://www.parishpatience.com.au/student-visa-cancellation-consequences-australia/)).\n\n*   **For the Institution:** Failure to comply with ESOS regulations can result in sanctions, including suspension or cancellation of the institution's registration on CRICOS ([Department of Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)). This can severely impact the institution's ability to recruit and enroll international students.\n\n**Genuine Student Requirement (GS)**\n\nIt is important to note that as of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The GS assesses the applicant's intention to study in Australia. While this requirement is primarily assessed during the initial visa application, the institution should be mindful of the GS when evaluating the student's reasons for absence and their commitment to their studies.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe institution has a critical role in monitoring and supporting international students to ensure they meet their visa obligations. In the case of the student who has been absent for two weeks, the institution must act promptly and in accordance with ESOS regulations. By following the steps outlined in this report, the institution can demonstrate its commitment to compliance, support the student in addressing their challenges, and mitigate the risk of negative consequences for both the student and the institution. The institution should prioritize communication, offer support services, and adhere to its documented policies and procedures for attendance monitoring and reporting.\n\n**References**\n\nAuthor, A.

      "full_response": "## Australia Student Visa Requirements for a 17-Year-Old Student in 2025\n\nFor a 17-year-old student planning to study in Australia in 2025, several specific requirements and conditions under the student visa (Subclass 500) must be met. These encompass age-related criteria, welfare arrangements, academic progress, financial capacity, health insurance, and adherence to Australian laws. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of these requirements, drawing from recent updates and guidelines to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Age Requirements and Enrollment\n\nThe Australian student visa program has specific age-related requirements, particularly for younger students. While the minimum age to apply for a student visa is six years old, additional age restrictions apply based on the year level the student will be entering. For a 17-year-old, the relevant year levels and age limits are:\n\n*   **Year 9:** Must be under 17 years old ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n*   **Year 10:** Must be under 18 years old ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n*   **Year 11:** Must be under 19 years old ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\nSince the student is 17 years old, they can enroll in either Year 10 or Year 11, depending on their academic progression. Enrollment in a full-time course registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) is mandatory ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). A Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from the educational institution is a crucial document for the visa application, confirming the student's acceptance and enrollment in the course ([globalvisanet.com](https://globalvisanet.com/2025/01/07/australian-student-visa-process-is-change-in-2025/)). As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is required for all onshore student visa applications, replacing the previously accepted Letter of Offer ([vinoeducationconsulting.com](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n\n### Welfare and Custody Requirements\n\nGiven that the student is under 18, stringent welfare and custody arrangements must be in place. The Australian government requires evidence of adequate welfare arrangements to ensure the student's well-being ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). These arrangements must cover the student until they turn 18 and must be continuous, even if the student is studying with multiple providers ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\nAcceptable welfare arrangements include:\n\n*   **Living with a parent or legal guardian:** If the student will be living with a parent or legal guardian, relevant documents such as birth certificates and custody papers must be provided ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Nominated guardian:** If not living with a parent or legal guardian, a guardian can be nominated. The nominated guardian must be at least 21 years old and can be an Australian citizen, permanent resident, or hold a temporary substantive visa or Subclass 590 visa ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). Form 157N (Nomination of a Student Guardian) must be completed, and the guardian must apply for a Student Guardian visa (Subclass TU-590) ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n*   **Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW):** The education provider can arrange a CAAW, confirming suitable accommodation and welfare arrangements. This is not required if the student is a secondary exchange student or sponsored by Foreign Affairs or Defence ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\nForm 1229 (Consent to grant an Australian visa to a child under 18) must be signed by both parents or legal guardians, providing consent for the visa to be granted. If only one parent has custody, evidence of this must be provided ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). Police certificates are required for each country the nominated guardian has lived in for over 12 months in the last 10 years, unless the guardian is a parent or legal custodian ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\n### Financial Capacity\n\nInternational students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and health insurance for the duration of their stay ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). As of 2025, the required living costs are AUD 21,041 per year ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Acceptable proof of funds includes bank statements (covering the last three months), education loans, scholarships, and fixed deposits ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The minimum bank balance required is AUD 29,710 ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\n### English Language Proficiency\n\nWhile the 17-year-old student may need to provide proof of English language skills, certain exemptions apply. Citizens with a passport from the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand, or the Republic of Ireland are exempt from providing an English test score ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). If required, the student can provide scores from approved English language tests such as IELTS, PTE, CAE, or OET ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\nThe minimum IELTS score for a student visa is 6.0, increased from 5.5 in March 2024 ([studyabroad.careers360.com](https://studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/australian-student-visa-new-rules-2025-for-indian-students)). Equivalent scores in other tests are also accepted, such as a TOEFL iBT score of 60 overall or a PTE Academic score of 50 overall ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nAs of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Student (GS) requirement replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). This ensures that applicants are genuine students with the primary goal of studying in Australia. The visa application includes questions to prove the student meets the GS criteria, covering current circumstances, course choice, relevance to future employment, and expected benefits ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)).\n\n### Health Insurance\n\nAll international students must have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the entire duration of their stay in Australia ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). OSHC provides coverage for medical treatments, hospital care, and ambulance services ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Failure to maintain valid OSHC can result in visa conditions not being met ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Visa Conditions and Compliance\n\nSeveral conditions must be adhered to while holding a student visa:\n\n*   **Study Condition:** Maintain enrollment in a registered course and ensure satisfactory course progress and attendance ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Changes in course or institution must be reported to the Department of Home Affairs ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Work Rights:** Students are allowed to work up to 48 hours per fortnight during term time and unlimited hours during scheduled course breaks ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Overworking can lead to visa cancellation ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Address Notification:** Notify the education provider of the Australian address within seven days of arriving and update any change of address within seven days of moving ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).### Visa Application Cost and Processing\n\nThe base application fee for the main applicant is AUD 1,600, unless exempt ([insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)). Additional charges apply for family members applying with the student ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). Extra costs may include health checks, police certificates, and biometrics ([kansaz.in](https://www.kansaz.in/blog/australia-study-visa-requirements)). Visa processing times typically range from 4-6 weeks, so it is advisable to submit the application well in advance ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a 17-year-old student applying for an Australian student visa in 2025 must meet specific age and enrollment criteria, ensure adequate welfare arrangements, demonstrate financial capacity, meet English language proficiency standards (if applicable), satisfy the Genuine Student requirement, and maintain valid health insurance. Adhering to visa conditions and compliance requirements is crucial for the duration of their stay in Australia. Recent changes, such as the mandatory CoE for onshore applications and the increased English language proficiency standards, highlight the need for careful preparation and adherence to the latest guidelines.\n\n### References\n\nKansaz.

      "full_response": "## Report on the Impact of Australia's Updated Student Visa Rules for 2025 on Students Previously Under Streamlined Arrangements\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAustralia's international education sector has undergone significant changes, particularly concerning student visa regulations. Effective January 1, 2025, new rules were implemented, impacting both onshore and offshore student visa applications. A key change is the mandatory requirement of a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for all student visa applications, replacing the previously accepted Letters of Offer ([Srivastava, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/australias-updated-student-visa-rules-2025-key-you-know-srivastava-qtylc)). This report examines the implications of these changes, specifically focusing on students who initially gained their student visas under the Streamlined arrangements, and offers a considered opinion on the overall impact.\n\n**Background: Streamlined Visa Processing**\n\nPrior to the 2025 updates, Australia's Streamlined Visa Processing (SVP) arrangements simplified the visa application process for students from certain countries and those enrolling in specific courses at participating education providers. This system aimed to expedite visa processing for students deemed to be at a lower risk of non-compliance ([Erickson Immigration Group, 2025](https://eiglaw.com/australia-changes-onshore-student-visa-applications/)). Under SVP, eligible students often benefited from reduced evidentiary requirements and faster processing times. However, the introduction of mandatory CoE requirements and other policy shifts have altered the landscape for all international students, including those who initially benefited from streamlined processing.\n\n**The Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) Requirement**\n\nThe most significant change affecting all student visa applicants, including those previously under Streamlined arrangements, is the mandatory CoE ([Leading Edge, 2025](https://www.leadingedgemigration.com.au/post/australian-student-visa-changes-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know)). A CoE is an official document issued by an Australian educational institution confirming a student's acceptance into a registered course. It includes details such as the student's name, course name, duration, and tuition fees ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\nPreviously, students could use a Letter of Offer to support their visa application, which indicated provisional acceptance into a course. The new rule mandates that students must now fully enroll, pay at least a portion of their tuition fees, and obtain a CoE before applying for a student visa ([Global Visa Net, 2025](https://globalvisanet.com/2025/01/07/australian-student-visa-process-is-change-in-2025/)). This change aims to strengthen visa integrity and ensure that only genuine students are granted visas ([Vino Education Consulting, 2025](https://vinoeducationconsulting.com/australia-student-visa-confirmation-of-enrolment-is-now-required-from-january-2025/)).\n\n**Impact on Students Previously Under Streamlined Arrangements**\n\nWhile the Streamlined arrangements may have facilitated easier initial visa grants, the new CoE requirement applies equally to all onshore student visa applicants, regardless of their previous visa history. This means that students who initially benefited from SVP are now subject to the same stricter requirements as all other applicants.\n\nSpecifically, these students must:\n\n*   **Secure a CoE:** They must ensure they are fully enrolled in a registered course and have obtained a CoE from their education provider ([Visa and Immigrations, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **Plan Ahead:** They need to allow sufficient time to secure a CoE before their current visa expires, as applications without a CoE will be deemed invalid ([Legacy Migration, 2025](https://www.legacymigration.com.au/news-updates/onshore-student-visa-applicants-new-requirements-for-2025)).\n*   **Maintain Lawful Status:** If they cannot obtain a CoE before their current visa expires, they must either depart Australia or explore other visa options ([Erickson Immigration Group, 2025](https://eiglaw.com/australia-changes-onshore-student-visa-applications/)).\n\n**Other Relevant Changes and Considerations**\n\nBeyond the CoE requirement, several other changes impact international students in Australia:\n\n*   **Increased Visa Fees:** The Australian government has significantly increased student visa application fees. As of July 1, 2024, the fee for the Student visa (subclass 500) increased by 225%, from AUD $710 to AUD $1,600 ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-hikes-student-visa-fees-by-225/)). This represents a substantial financial burden for many students. Furthermore, as of the current date, March 3, 2025, the primary applicant fee is AUD 1,750 ([My New Australian Life, 2024](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/visa-application-australia-fee-simplified-guide/)).\n*   **Cap on International Student Enrollments:** A National Planning Level (NPL) cap has been introduced, limiting the number of new international students to 270,000 per year ([Srivastava, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/australias-updated-student-visa-rules-2025-key-you-know-srivastava-qtylc)). This policy aims to manage the growth of the education sector and align it with Australia's infrastructure and economic capacity.\n*   **Restrictions on Visa Hopping:** The government has implemented stricter measures to curb \"visa hopping,\" where individuals continuously extend their stay in Australia by switching between temporary visas ([Legacy Migration, 2025](https://www.legacymigration.com.au/news-updates/onshore-student-visa-applicants-new-requirements-for-2025)). Visitor visa holders and Temporary Graduate visa holders are now generally restricted from applying for Student visas onshore.\n\n**Opinion: A Necessary but Potentially Burdensome Shift**\n\nIn my opinion, the shift to mandatory CoE requirements for all onshore student visa applicants, including those previously under Streamlined arrangements, is a necessary step to enhance the integrity of Australia's international education system. By requiring full enrollment and upfront tuition payments, the government aims to reduce fraudulent applications and ensure that only genuine students are granted visas. This aligns onshore application requirements with those for offshore applicants, creating a more consistent and transparent system.\n\nHowever, this change also introduces potential burdens for international students. The increased financial commitment required to obtain a CoE, coupled with the already substantial increase in visa fees, may make it more difficult for some students to pursue their education in Australia. Additionally, the stricter requirements and limitations on visa hopping may restrict the flexibility of international students and make it more challenging for them to extend their stay in Australia for further study or work opportunities.\n\nThe introduction of a cap on international student enrollments also raises concerns about access to education. While the policy aims to manage growth and align it with Australia's capacity, it could potentially limit opportunities for deserving students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nOverall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in Australia's approach to managing its education migration framework. While the goal of enhancing integrity and quality is commendable, it is crucial for the government to monitor the impact of these changes on international students and ensure that the system remains accessible and supportive for genuine learners. Education providers and relevant stakeholders should also provide adequate support and guidance to help students navigate the new requirements and address any challenges they may face.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe updated student visa rules for 2025 in Australia, particularly the mandatory CoE requirement, have significant implications for all international students, including those who previously benefited from Streamlined arrangements. While the changes aim to enhance visa integrity and ensure genuine student participation, they also introduce potential financial and logistical burdens. Students must be aware of these changes, plan accordingly, and seek guidance from education providers and migration agents to navigate the new requirements effectively. The Australian government should continue to monitor the impact of these changes and make adjustments as needed to maintain a fair and accessible international education system.\n\n**References**\n\nErickson Immigration Group.

      "full_response": "## Understanding Visa Condition 8201 for Prospective Students in Australia\n\nA prospective student planning a two-month visit to Australia to see relatives is considering studying English while there. Her tourist visa includes condition 8201. This report will explain the implications of this condition for her study plans, drawing upon information from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation. The report will cover the meaning of condition 8201, its implications for study, alternative visa options, and steps the student can take to ensure compliance with Australian visa regulations.\n\n### Meaning of Visa Condition 8201\n\nVisa condition 8201, commonly attached to tourist visas in Australia, restricts the holder from engaging in studies or training for more than three months ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)). This condition is designed to prevent individuals from misusing short-term visas, such as tourist visas, as a substitute for a formal student visa ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)). The Australian Department of Home Affairs imposes this condition to ensure that visitors do not undertake long-term educational programs without the appropriate visa, which is specifically designed for educational purposes ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)).\n\n### Implications for Study\n\nGiven that the prospective student's tourist visa includes condition 8201, she is permitted to study in Australia for a maximum of three months ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)). Since her visit is planned for two months, she can enroll in an English course without violating her visa conditions, as long as the course duration does not exceed this period. However, if she intends to study for longer than three months, she would need to apply for a student visa, such as the Subclass 500 visa ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)).\n\n### Alternative Visa Options: Subclass 500 Student Visa\n\nIf the prospective student decides she wants to study English for longer than two months, she will need to consider applying for a Subclass 500 student visa ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)). This visa is specifically designed for international students who plan to study full-time in Australia at a registered educational institution ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n#### Key Features of the Subclass 500 Visa\n\n*   **Length of Stay:** The visa is typically granted for the duration of the study program, with additional time depending on the course length ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).*   **Work Rights:** Students can work up to 48 hours per fortnight during their studies and unlimited hours during official course breaks ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Family Inclusion:** Eligible family members, such as a partner or dependent children, can be included in the visa application ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Flexibility:** It covers a range of study levels, from primary school to postgraduate research ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n#### Eligibility Criteria for the Subclass 500 Visa\n\nTo apply for a Subclass 500 visa, the prospective student must meet several requirements:\n\n*   **Enrolment in a Registered Course:** Provide a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from an institution registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) Requirement:** Demonstrate that their intention to stay in Australia is temporary and directly related to their studies ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Financial Requirements:** Show evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living costs, and travel expenses ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). As of 2025, living costs are AUD 21,041 per year ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** Provide up-to-date test results that meet the required scores ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Health Insurance:** Obtain Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the entire duration of the visa ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Character and Health Requirements:** Meet the character and health requirements set by the Department of Home Affairs ([Ausimmi, n.d.](https://ausimmi.com.au/500-visa/)).\n\n#### Financial Requirements in Detail\n\nThe financial requirements for the Subclass 500 visa include demonstrating sufficient funds to cover:\n\n*   **Living Costs:** AUD 21,041 per year as of 2025 ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Travel Expenses:** Approximately AUD 2,000 - AUD 3,000 ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Course Fees:** The first 12 months of course fees ([Ausimmi, n.d.](https://ausimmi.com.au/500-visa/)).\n\nAcceptable proof of funds includes bank statements, education loans, scholarships, and fixed deposits ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n#### Visa Conditions and Rights\n\nThe Subclass 500 visa comes with specific conditions and rights that the student must adhere to:\n\n*   **Study Condition:** Maintain enrolment in a registered course and satisfactory course progress and attendance ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Any changes in course or institution must be notified to the Department of Home Affairs ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Work Rights:** Limited work rights during term time, allowing up to 48 hours per fortnight ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Unlimited work hours are permitted during scheduled course breaks ([Kangaroo Edu, n.d.](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Health Insurance:** Maintain valid OSHC throughout the stay ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Recent Changes to Student Visa Rules in 2025\n\nSeveral changes to the student visa rules in 2025 may affect the prospective student's plans:\n\n*   **Certificate of Enrollment (CoE):** Obtaining a CoE is now a critical step in the application process ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Financial Costs:** Increased financial costs require applicants to budget accordingly ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). The application fee is AUD 1,600 ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Onshore Applications:** Restrictions on onshore applications for those on temporary visas unless all requirements are met, including holding a CoE ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **National Planning Level (NPL) Cap:** A cap of 270,000 new international student commencements for 2025 ([Visa and Immigrations, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Steps to Ensure Compliance\n\nTo ensure compliance with Australian visa regulations, the prospective student should:\n\n1.  **Verify Visa Conditions:** Use the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) system to check the conditions attached to her tourist visa ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)).\n2.  **Limit Study to Three Months:** If remaining on the tourist visa, ensure that any English course does not exceed three months ([VisaVerge.com, n.d.](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/what-do-condition-numbers-on-australian-visas-mean/)).\n3.  **Apply for a Student Visa if Necessary:** If planning to study longer than three months, apply for a Subclass 500 student visa well in advance ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n4.  **Obtain a CoE:** Secure a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from a CRICOS-registered institution ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n5.  **Meet Financial Requirements:** Gather evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living costs, and travel expenses ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n6.  **Maintain Health Insurance:** Ensure valid OSHC coverage for the duration of the stay ([Immigration News Australia, 2025](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n7.  **Monitor Visa Validity:** Keep track of the visa\u2019s expiration date and avoid overstaying ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the prospective student's tourist visa with condition 8201 allows her to study in Australia for up to three months. Since her visit is planned for two months, she can enroll in an English course without violating her visa conditions. However, if she wishes to study for a longer period, she must apply for a Subclass 500 student visa, ensuring she meets all eligibility criteria and complies with the visa conditions. By staying informed and taking the necessary steps, she can ensure a smooth and compliant stay in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nAusimmi.

It provides guidance based on Australian regulations, university policies, and support services available to international students. The report aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the situation, focusing on attendance requirements, leave options, health coverage, and available support systems.\n\n**Attendance Requirements for International Students**\n\nInternational students in Australia are generally required to maintain satisfactory attendance in their enrolled courses as a condition of their student visa ([KangarooEdu.au, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025)). The Department of Home Affairs mandates that students must attend a minimum percentage of their scheduled classes, often around 80%, to meet visa requirements ([Swinburne, n.d.](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/courses/visas/attendance-requirements/)).\n\n*   **Specifics of Attendance Monitoring:** Educational institutions monitor student attendance and report any breaches to the Department of Home Affairs ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/changing-your-enrolment/discontinuation-leave)). Unsatisfactory attendance can lead to warnings and, if not improved, potential cancellation of the student visa ([Policies.SCU.edu.au, n.d.](https://policies.scu.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=203)).\n\n*   **Impact of Absences:** Missing classes can affect a student's academic progress and visa status. The NSW Department of Education analysis of attendance data last year found 9,729,900 days were missed by public school students ([SMH, 2025](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/9-729-900-days-lost-in-one-year-the-shocking-truth-about-our-schools-20250122-p5l6e6.html)).\n\n**Leave of Absence Policies**\n\nUniversities in Australia have provisions for leave of absence, allowing students to temporarily suspend their studies under certain conditions ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n*   **Types of Leave:** Common types of leave include intermission (suspension of studies), sick leave, parental leave, and compelling and compassionate leave ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n*   **Exceptional Circumstances:** International students are generally permitted to take leave only in exceptional circumstances, as outlined in the Deferring, Suspending or Cancelling an International Student's Enrolment: Policy and Procedures ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n*   **Application Process:** An application for leave must be made prior to taking leave, except in unplanned circumstances, in which case the application must be submitted within 30 days of the event ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)). Medical documents or evidence will be required to process the leave application ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n*   **Notification Requirements:** The university is required by law to report to the Department of Home Affairs any event affecting the enrolment of an overseas student within 14 days ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n**Health Insurance and Medical Services**\n\nInternational students are required to have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of their stay in Australia ([KangarooEdu.au, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025)).\n\n*   **OSHC Coverage:** OSHC helps cover the costs of medical and hospital care, as well as some prescription medications ([nib.com.au, n.d.](https://www.nib.com.au/the-checkup/international-students-what-do-i-do-if-im-taken-to-hospital)).\n\n*   **Accessing Medical Services:** International students can access a range of medical services, including general practitioners (GPs), specialists, and hospital care. In case of hospitalization, it's important to contact the OSHC provider to understand the coverage and payment process ([AccessHC.org.au, n.d.](https://accesshc.org.au/support-services-for-international-students/)).\n\n*   **Mental Health Services:** Mental health services are also available, with many institutions offering counseling services to international students ([StudiesinAustralia.com, n.d.](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services)).\n\n**Student Support Services**Australian educational institutions are required to provide support services to help international students adjust to their new environment ([StudiesinAustralia.com, n.d.](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services)).\n\n*   **Types of Support:** These services include orientation programs, academic assistance, counseling, and support for family members ([StudiesinAustralia.com, n.d.](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services)).\n\n*   **International Student Support Units:** Many institutions have dedicated international student support units that can answer questions and direct students to the services they need ([StudiesinAustralia.com, n.d.](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services)).\n\n*   **University of Canberra Support:** The University of Canberra provides Student Wellbeing & International Support (SWIS) staff members who meet with students regularly to discuss academic progress ([Policies.Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://policies.canberra.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=190&version=1)).\n\n**Advice to Parents**\n\nBased on the information gathered, here's the advice to provide to the parents:\n\n1.  **Immediate Steps:**\n\n    *   **Inform the University:** Notify the university's international student support services and the relevant department or faculty about the student's hospitalization. This is crucial for initiating the necessary procedures and support ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n    *   **Contact OSHC Provider:** Contact the Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) provider to confirm coverage for the hospital stay and any related medical expenses ([nib.com.au, n.d.](https://www.nib.com.au/the-checkup/international-students-what-do-i-do-if-im-taken-to-hospital)).\n    *   **Gather Medical Documentation:** Obtain all necessary medical documentation from the hospital, including a medical certificate stating the student's inability to attend classes ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n2.  **Leave of Absence Application:**\n\n    *   **Apply for Sick Leave:** If the leave is expected to exceed 10 working days, apply for sick leave. Ensure the application is submitted within 30 days of the event if the leave was unplanned ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n    *   **Provide Evidence:** Submit the medical certificate and any other required documentation to support the leave application ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n\n3.  **Visa Considerations:**\n\n    *   **Inform DHA:** Understand that the university is required to notify the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) about the student's leave. This may affect the student's visa, and it's essential to comply with any instructions provided by the DHA ([Canberra.edu.au, n.d.](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-research-students/study/leave-of-absence)).\n    *   **Potential Visa Cancellation:** Be aware that leave of absence may lead to visa cancellation, requiring the student to depart Australia unless there are exceptional circumstances ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/changing-your-enrolment/discontinuation-leave)).\n\n4.  **Ongoing Support:**\n\n    *   **Maintain Communication:** Keep in close contact with the university's international student support services for updates and guidance.\n    *   **Access Counseling Services:** Encourage the student to utilize the university's counseling services for emotional and psychological support during this challenging time ([StudiesinAustralia.com, n.d.](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services)).\n    *   **Monitor Academic Progress:** Once the student recovers, work with the university to develop a plan for catching up on missed coursework and assessments.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNavigating an international student's illness requires prompt action and clear communication with the university and relevant authorities. By following the guidelines outlined in this report, parents can ensure their son receives the necessary medical care and support while minimizing the impact on his academic progress and visa status. The key is to act quickly, provide all required documentation, and maintain open communication with the university's international student support services.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Access Health and Community.

      "full_response": "## Report on Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for ELICOS and Masters Programs in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses a query regarding Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) requirements for an international student transitioning from an English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) program to a Masters of Biotechnology course in Australia. The student has already paid OSHC for the ELICOS program and is now being asked to pay again for the Masters program. This report will provide advice to a counsellor on how to proceed, considering Australian regulations and best practices.\n\n**Background on OSHC**\n\nOverseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) is a mandatory health insurance requirement for most international students holding a student visa (subclass 500) in Australia ([admissionsoverseas.com](https://admissionsoverseas.com/universities/australia/visa-process-and-requirements-australla)). It ensures that international students have access to medical and hospital services during their stay in Australia ([unicreds.com](https://unicreds.com/blog/student-health-insurance-australia/)). The Department of Home Affairs mandates that students maintain continuous OSHC coverage for the duration of their visa ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc)). Failure to maintain OSHC can lead to visa cancellation ([cohortgo.com](https://cohortgo.com/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)).\n\nOSHC typically covers visits to the doctor, some hospital treatments, ambulance services, and limited prescription medications ([internationalstudents.health.nsw.gov.au](https://internationalstudents.health.nsw.gov.au/)). However, it's important to note that standard policies may not cover dental, physiotherapy, or optical services, although advanced plans can be purchased to include these extras ([macrohubedu.com](https://macrohubedu.com/blogs/oshc-students-australia)).\n\n**Analysis of the Student's Situation**\n\nThe student is transitioning from an ELICOS program to a Masters program. Even though the student has already paid for OSHC during the ELICOS program, the university is requesting that the student pay for OSHC again for the Masters program. The key to resolving this issue lies in understanding the duration of the student's current OSHC policy and the visa requirements associated with the Masters program.\n\n**Advice to the Counsellor**\n\nBased on the information available, the counsellor should advise the student to take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Verify the Expiry Date of the Current OSHC Policy:** The first and most crucial step is to determine when the student's current OSHC policy expires ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)). This information can be found on the OSHC membership card or by contacting the OSHC provider directly ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)).\n\n2.  **Assess the Visa Requirements for the Masters Program:** The student needs to ensure that their visa covers the entire duration of the Masters program. If the ELICOS visa expires before the Masters program commences, a new student visa (subclass 500) will be required ([admissionsoverseas.com](https://admissionsoverseas.com/universities/australia/visa-process-and-requirements-australla)).\n\n3.  **Determine the Overlap Between OSHC and Visa Validity:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Current OSHC Covers the Start of the Masters Program:** If the student's current OSHC policy extends beyond the start date of the Masters program and the visa is also valid, the student may not need to purchase a new OSHC policy immediately. However, it is crucial to ensure that the OSHC policy covers the entire duration of the Masters program. The student will eventually need to extend or renew their OSHC policy to align with the Masters program's end date ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/a-guide-to-oshc-renewal-for-international-students-in-australia)).\n    *   **Scenario 2: Current OSHC Expires Before the Masters Program Starts:** If the current OSHC policy expires before the Masters program begins, the student will need to purchase a new OSHC policy to cover the gap. This is a mandatory requirement to maintain visa compliance ([cohortgo.com](https://cohortgo.com/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)).\n    *   **Scenario 3: New Visa Required for Masters Program:** If a new visa is required for the Masters program, the student will almost certainly need to demonstrate that they have OSHC coverage for the duration of the new visa. In this case, the university's request for OSHC payment is likely justified.\n\n4.  **Contact the OSHC Provider:** The student should contact their current OSHC provider to discuss options for extending or renewing their policy ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)). Providers like BUPA, Medibank, NIB, and Allianz Care Australia offer OSHC plans for various study durations ([unicreds.com](https://unicreds.com/blog/student-health-insurance-australia/)). The student should inquire about the process for extending the policy, any associated costs, and whether the existing policy can be transferred to cover the Masters program.\n\n5.  **Communicate with the University:** The student should communicate with the university's international student support services to explain their situation and provide proof of their existing OSHC coverage. If the OSHC policy covers the initial period of the Masters program, the university may allow the student to defer the OSHC payment until the existing policy is close to expiry.\n\n6.  **Consider Policy Options:** The student should compare different OSHC plans to ensure they have adequate coverage for their needs ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc)). While basic OSHC covers essential medical services, students may want to consider more comprehensive plans that include dental, optical, and physiotherapy coverage ([macrohubedu.com](https://macrohubedu.com/blogs/oshc-students-australia)).\n\n7.  **Extend or Renew OSHC Policy:** If the student needs to extend or renew their OSHC policy, they should do so well in advance of the expiry date to avoid any lapses in coverage ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/a-guide-to-oshc-renewal-for-international-students-in-australia)). Most OSHC providers offer online platforms for extending or renewing policies ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)).\n\n8.  **Inform the Department of Home Affairs (If Necessary):** If the student extends their visa or OSHC policy, they may need to inform the Department of Home Affairs to ensure their visa remains compliant ([budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)).\n\n**Importance of Continuous OSHC Coverage**\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize to the student the importance of maintaining continuous OSHC coverage throughout their stay in Australia ([cohortgo.com](https://cohortgo.com/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)). Lapses in coverage can lead to:\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** Failure to comply with visa condition 8501, which requires OSHC, can result in visa cancellation ([oshcaustralia.com.au](https://oshcaustralia.com.au/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)).\n*   **Significant Medical Expenses:** Without OSHC, the student will be responsible for all medical expenses, which can be very costly in Australia ([cohortgo.com](https://cohortgo.com/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)).\n*   **Difficulty Accessing Healthcare:** Some healthcare providers may be reluctant to treat patients without valid health insurance.\n\n**ELICOS and Student Visas**\n\nIt is important to briefly address ELICOS programs and their relationship to student visas. ELICOS programs are designed to improve English language skills for international students ([ozstudies.com](https://www.ozstudies.com/studying-in-australia/what-to-study-in-australia/elicos-english-language-courses-overview)). Students can apply for a student visa (subclass 500) to study ELICOS ([leapscholar.com](https://leapscholar.com/blog/all-about-elicos-australia-fees-courses-requirements/)). If the ELICOS course is shorter than three months, a visitor visa or working holiday visa might be sufficient ([leapscholar.com](https://leapscholar.com/blog/all-about-elicos-australia-fees-courses-requirements/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the university's request for the student to pay OSHC for the Masters program is likely valid, especially if a new visa is required or if the student's current OSHC policy does not cover the entire duration of the Masters program. The counsellor should advise the student to verify their OSHC expiry date, assess visa requirements, contact their OSHC provider, communicate with the university, and extend or renew their OSHC policy as needed. Maintaining continuous OSHC coverage is essential for visa compliance and accessing healthcare in Australia.\n\n**References**\n\n[admissionsoverseas.com](https://admissionsoverseas.com/universities/australia/visa-process-and-requirements-australla)\n[unicreds.com](https://unicreds.com/blog/student-health-insurance-australia/)\n[studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc)\n[cohortgo.com](https://cohortgo.com/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)\n[internationalstudents.health.nsw.gov.au](https://internationalstudents.health.nsw.gov.au/)\n[macrohubedu.com](https://macrohubedu.com/blogs/oshc-students-australia)\n[budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/how-to-extend-your-oshc-policy-the-complete-guide-for-students-in-australia)[budgetpolicy.com](https://budgetpolicy.com/blogs/detail/a-guide-to-oshc-renewal-for-international-students-in-australia)\n[oshcaustralia.com.au](https://oshcaustralia.com.au/en/blog/renewing-your-oshc-policy)\n[ozstudies.com](https://www.ozstudies.com/studying-in-australia/what-to-study-in-australia/elicos-english-language-courses-overview)\n[leapscholar.com](https://leapscholar.com/blog/all-about-elicos-australia-fees-courses-requirements/)"

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the scenario, adhering to the specified guidelines:### Report: Disclosure of Student Information to Parents in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the scenario where the parents of a 21-year-old student request her academic results from the Australian institution where she is studying. It will analyze the legal and policy frameworks governing the release of student information in Australia, focusing on privacy laws and institutional policies. The report will provide a definitive opinion on how the institution should respond to this request, based on a thorough evaluation of the available information.\n\n**Overview of Australian Privacy Laws**\n\nAustralia has a comprehensive legal framework designed to protect the privacy of individuals, including students. The cornerstone of this framework is the *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth), which outlines the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that govern how organizations handle personal information ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/using-site/privacy)). The *Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024* (Cth) brought significant updates to the *Privacy Act 1988*, enhancing enforcement powers and introducing new rights for data subjects ([Baker McKenzie InsightPlus](https://insightplus.bakermckenzie.com/bm/data-technology/australia-australian-privacy-developments-what-do-you-need-to-know-for-2025)).\n\nKey aspects of the *Privacy Act* relevant to this scenario include:\n\n1.  **Consent:** Organizations must obtain consent from individuals before disclosing their personal information to third parties.\n2.  **Information Security:** Organizations must take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorized access or disclosure.\n3.  **Access and Correction:** Individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to correct it if necessary.\n\n**Age of Majority and Capacity to Consent**\n\nIn Australia, the age of majority is 18 years, meaning that individuals are legally considered adults and responsible for their actions from this age ([Writing and information tools for Internet users](https://www.presentation-cv-simple.com/en/what-is-the-age-of-the-majority-in-australia/)). Since the student in question is 21 years old, she is legally an adult and has the capacity to make her own decisions regarding her personal information. The *Privacy Act 1988* does not specify a minimum age for making privacy decisions; instead, it focuses on the individual's capacity to consent ([OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/more-privacy-rights/children-and-young-people)).\n\n**University Policies on Student Information Disclosure**\n\nMany Australian universities have specific policies in place regarding the release of student information. These policies generally align with the principles of the *Privacy Act* and emphasize the importance of student consent. For example:\n\n*   **Macquarie University:** The university will not release information about present or past students to third parties without the student's written consent. This includes requests from parents, spouses, employers, or other parties ([Macquarie University](https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=402&version=1)).\n*   **UNSW:** The university cannot disclose information without the student's consent and has implemented measures to comply with the *Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998* (NSW). Students can authorize the release of information to a third party, such as a parent, via a Third Party Authorisation form ([UNSW Current Students](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/supporters)).\n*   **Federation University:** The university may release students\u2019 personal information with the student's consent or if required by law. The university also has a *Privacy Officer* who can be contacted for privacy-related matters ([Federation University](https://policy.federation.edu.au/corporate_governance/procedures/information_privacy/ch01.php)).\n\nThese policies reflect a commitment to protecting student privacy and ensuring that students have control over their personal information.\n\n**Analysis of the Scenario**\n\nIn this scenario, the parents are requesting the academic results of their 21-year-old daughter. Given that the student is an adult and has the legal capacity to make her own decisions, the institution should not release her academic results to her parents without her explicit written consent. This position is supported by the *Privacy Act 1988* and the privacy policies of Australian universities, which prioritize student privacy and autonomy.\n\nThe institution's responsibility is to protect the student's personal information and ensure that it is only disclosed with her consent or when required by law. Releasing the information without consent would be a breach of privacy and could have legal consequences for the institution.**Exceptions and Considerations**\n\nWhile the general rule is that student information should not be released without consent, there are limited exceptions:\n\n*   **Legal Requirement:** If a court order or subpoena requires the institution to release the information, it may be obligated to do so ([Macquarie University](https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=402&version=1)).\n*   **Emergency Situations:** In cases of an emergency or exceptional circumstances where there is a serious and imminent threat to the health, safety, or wellbeing of the student or others, the institution may be justified in releasing information ([UNSW Current Students](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/information-disclosure)).\n\nHowever, these exceptions do not apply in this scenario, as there is no legal requirement or emergency situation that would justify releasing the student's academic results to her parents without her consent.**Recommended Course of Action**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the institution should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Decline the Request:** Inform the parents that the institution cannot release the student's academic results without her written consent.\n2.  **Inform the Student:** Notify the student that her parents have requested her academic results and explain the institution's privacy policy.\n3.  **Obtain Consent (if applicable):** If the student wishes to share her results with her parents, provide her with a Third Party Authorisation form or similar document to grant her consent.\n4.  **Document the Interaction:** Keep a record of the request and the institution's response, including any communication with the parents and the student.\n\nBy following these steps, the institution can ensure that it is complying with its legal and ethical obligations to protect student privacy.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the institution should not provide the parents with a copy of their 21-year-old daughter's academic results without her explicit written consent. This decision is firmly grounded in Australian privacy laws, university policies, and the principle of respecting the autonomy of adult students. The institution should prioritize the student's privacy rights and follow the recommended course of action to ensure compliance with its legal and ethical obligations.\n\n**Reference List**\n\n*   Baker McKenzie InsightPlus.

      "full_response": "# Responding to a DHA Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation: A Detailed Guide\n\nWhen an international student in Australia receives a \"Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation\" from the Department of Home Affairs (DHA), it signals a critical juncture that demands immediate and informed action. This notice indicates that the DHA is contemplating the cancellation of the student's visa due to potential breaches of visa conditions or other concerns. Understanding the process, timelines, and available options is paramount to protecting one's immigration status. This report provides a comprehensive guide to responding to such a notice, drawing upon various sources to offer clarity and actionable advice.\n\n## Understanding the Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation\n\nThe \"Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation\" is a formal communication from the DHA outlining the reasons why the department is considering cancelling a visa ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)). This notice is typically issued when the DHA believes that the visa holder has failed to comply with visa conditions, such as maintaining satisfactory course progress, adhering to attendance requirements, or engaging in activities that violate Australian law ([AUM Global, 2024](https://aumglobal.com.au/blog-content/australian-visa-cancellation-process)).\n\n### Reasons for Visa Cancellation\n\nSeveral factors can trigger the issuance of a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation. Common reasons include:\n\n*   **Breach of Visa Conditions:** Failing to meet the requirements of visa condition 8202, which mandates satisfactory course attendance and progress for student visa holders ([VisaFAQ, n.d.](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n*   **Unsatisfactory Course Progress:** Not maintaining satisfactory academic performance, leading to exclusion from the course ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Insufficient Attendance:** Failing to meet the minimum attendance requirements set by the education provider and the DHA ([Department of Education and Training Victoria, n.d.](https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/international-student-program/guidance/supporting-students-learning-and-engagement-section-7)).\n*   **Criminal Convictions:** Being convicted of a crime that results in a prison sentence of 12 months or more, leading to a failure of the character test ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n*   **Providing Incorrect Information:** Supplying false or misleading information to the DHA ([Dojo Legal Australia, n.d.](https://www.dojolegal.com.au/visa-cancellation-and-the-appeal-process)).\n\n### Key Components of the Notice\n\nThe Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation typically includes the following key components:\n\n*   **Reasons for Potential Cancellation:** A detailed explanation of the specific reasons why the DHA is considering cancelling the visa.\n*   **Timeframe for Response:** A deadline by which the visa holder must provide a written response to the DHA.\n*   **Questions to Answer:** Specific questions that the visa holder must address in their response, such as whether they pass the character test and why their visa should not be cancelled ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n*   **Contact Information:** Details of the DHA officers or department to contact for further information or clarification.\n\n## Responding to the Notice: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nUpon receiving a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation, it is crucial to act promptly and strategically. The following steps outline a comprehensive approach to responding effectively:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Time Limit\n\nDetermining the exact deadline for responding to the notice is the first and most critical step. The calculation depends on how the notice was received:\n\n*   **Posted Notice:** Add 7 working days to the date on the last page of the notice, then add another 28 days (including weekends) ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n*   **Faxed or Emailed Notice:** Add 28 days (including weekends) from the date on the letter ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n\n**Example:** If a notice is emailed on March 3, 2025, the response deadline would be March 31, 2025.### 2. Seek Legal Counsel\n\nConsulting with an experienced immigration lawyer or registered migration agent is highly recommended ([Parish Patience Immigration Lawyers, n.d.](https://www.parishpatience.com.au/student-visa-cancellation-consequences-australia/)). A legal professional can:\n\n*   Assess the merits of the case and provide advice on the best course of action.\n*   Help gather and prepare supporting documentation.\n*   Draft a compelling written response to the DHA.\n*   Represent the visa holder in communication with the DHA.\n\n### 3. Gather Information and Evidence\n\nCompile all relevant information and evidence to support the response. This may include:\n\n*   **Academic Records:** Transcripts, course completion certificates, and letters from instructors or academic advisors ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Attendance Records:** Documentation of attendance at classes and explanations for any absences ([Department of Education and Training Victoria, n.d.](https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/international-student-program/guidance/supporting-students-learning-and-engagement-section-7)).\n*   **Medical Records:** Medical certificates or reports to explain any health-related issues that may have affected academic performance or attendance.\n*   **Character References:** Letters from community leaders, employers, or other individuals who can attest to the visa holder's good character.\n*   **Police Clearance Certificates:** If the notice relates to criminal activity, provide police clearance certificates from relevant jurisdictions.\n*   **Personal Statement:** A detailed statement explaining the circumstances surrounding the alleged breach and any mitigating factors ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n\n### 4. Prepare a Written Response\n\nThe written response to the DHA is a critical opportunity to present a case for why the visa should not be cancelled. The response should be:\n\n*   **Clear and Concise:** Clearly address each issue raised in the notice and provide a straightforward explanation.\n*   **Well-Organized:** Structure the response logically, using headings and subheadings to guide the reader.\n*   **Evidence-Based:** Support all claims with relevant evidence and documentation.\n*   **Persuasive:** Present a compelling argument for why the visa holder deserves to remain in Australia.\n*   **Professional:** Maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout the response.\n\nThe response should address the following key questions:\n\n*   **Do you pass the character test?** If the notice relates to criminal activity, address whether the visa holder meets the character requirements under Australian law ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)). If the criminal record is incorrect, provide evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracies.\n*   **Should your visa be cancelled?** Provide reasons why the visa should not be cancelled, even if the character test is not met or visa conditions have been breached ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)). This may include:\n    *   The risk of harm to the Australian community if the visa holder remains in Australia.\n    *   The consequences for the visa holder and their family if they are forced to leave Australia ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n    *   Mitigating circumstances that explain the breach of visa conditions.\n    *   Evidence of rehabilitation or positive contributions to the Australian community.\n\n### 5. Submit the Response\n\nSubmit the written response and all supporting documentation to the DHA by the specified deadline. Ensure that the submission is sent via a method that provides proof of delivery, such as registered mail or email with a delivery receipt.\n\n### 6. Maintain Communication with the DHA\n\nAfter submitting the response, maintain regular communication with the DHA to inquire about the status of the case ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)). Provide any additional information or documentation requested by the DHA in a timely manner.\n\n## Potential Outcomes and Appeal Options\n\nFollowing the review of the response, the DHA will make a decision on whether to cancel the visa. Potential outcomes include:\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** The DHA may decide to cancel the visa, requiring the visa holder to leave Australia ([AUM Global, 2024](https://aumglobal.com.au/blog-content/australian-visa-cancellation-process)).\n*   **Visa Not Cancelled:** The DHA may decide not to cancel the visa, allowing the visa holder to remain in Australia.\n*   **Warning Letter:** The DHA may issue a warning letter, outlining concerns about the visa holder's conduct and advising them to comply with visa conditions in the future ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.a](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n\nIf the DHA decides to cancel the visa, the visa holder has the right to appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) ([Dojo Legal Australia, n.d.](https://www.dojolegal.com.au/visa-cancellation-and-the-appeal-process)). The AAT is an independent body that reviews decisions made by Australian government agencies.\n\n### Appealing to the AAT\n\nTo appeal a visa cancellation decision to the AAT, the visa holder must:\n\n*   **Lodge an Application:** Submit an application to the AAT within the specified timeframe, typically 21 days from the date of the cancellation notice ([Dojo Legal Australia, n.d.](https://www.dojolegal.com.au/visa-cancellation-and-the-appeal-process)).\n*   **Pay the Appeal Fee:** Pay the required fee for lodging the appeal.\n*   **Prepare for the Hearing:** Gather evidence and prepare arguments to present at the AAT hearing.\n*   **Attend the Hearing:** Attend the AAT hearing and present a case for why the visa cancellation decision should be overturned.\n\nThe AAT can affirm, vary, or set aside the DHA's decision. If the AAT upholds the cancellation, further appeals may be possible, but they are typically limited to points of law and may require legal representation ([AUM Global, 2024](https://aumglobal.com.au/blog-content/australian-visa-cancellation-process)).\n\n## Compliance and Prevention\n\nThe best way to avoid visa cancellation is to comply with all visa conditions and Australian laws. Key steps to ensure compliance include:\n\n*   **Maintaining Enrolment and Course Progress:** Enrolling in a full-time registered course and maintaining satisfactory academic performance ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Meeting Attendance Requirements:** Attending classes regularly and meeting the minimum attendance requirements set by the education provider ([Department of Education and Training Victoria, n.d.](https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/international-student-program/guidance/supporting-students-learning-and-engagement-section-7)).\n*   **Paying Tuition Fees on Time:** Ensuring that tuition fees are paid by the due date to avoid enrolment cancellation ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Updating Address Information:** Notifying the education provider of any changes to residential address within 7 days ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Maintaining Overseas Health Cover:** Keeping Overseas Health Cover (OSHC) current for the entire duration of studies ([Charles Sturt University, n.d.a](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)).\n*   **Avoiding Criminal Activities:** Upholding Australian laws to prevent complications with the visa ([AUM Global, 2024](https://aumglobal.com.au/blog-content/australian-visa-cancellation-process)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReceiving a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation can be a distressing experience for international students in Australia. However, by understanding the process, acting promptly, and seeking professional advice, students can effectively respond to the notice and protect their immigration status. Compliance with visa conditions and Australian laws is the most effective way to prevent visa cancellation and ensure a successful and enjoyable stay in Australia.\n\n***\n\n## References\n\nAUM Global.

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Student Visa (Subclass 500) in 2025, incorporating recent updates, requirements, and application processes. It aims to equip prospective students with the knowledge necessary to navigate the application process successfully and understand the conditions and opportunities associated with this visa.\n\n### Overview of the Student Visa (Subclass 500)\n\nThe Student Visa (Subclass 500) is designed for international students intending to undertake full-time study in Australia at a registered educational institution ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). This visa encompasses a wide array of courses, including English language programs, vocational education and training (VET), higher education degrees, and postgraduate research ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). It offers flexibility by allowing applicants to include eligible family members, such as partners or dependent children, in their application ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). Furthermore, it permits students to work part-time during their studies, providing opportunities to gain work experience and financial support ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Key Features of the Student Visa (Subclass 500)\n\n*   **Length of Stay:** The visa is typically granted for the duration of the study program, with additional time depending on the course length ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). For courses longer than 10 months, additional time is usually granted ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Work Rights:** Students are generally allowed to work up to 48 hours per fortnight during study periods and unlimited hours during official course breaks ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Family Inclusion:** Eligible family members, such as a partner and dependent children, can be included in the visa application ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Eligibility Criteria\n\nTo be eligible for the Student Visa (Subclass 500), applicants must meet several criteria:\n\n*   **Enrolment in a Registered Course:** Applicants must be enrolled in a full-time course registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) Requirement:** Applicants must demonstrate a genuine intention to stay in Australia temporarily for the purpose of studying and return to their home country upon completion of their studies ([Amber Student](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/a-guide-to-gte-in-australia)). Note that the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement since March 23, 2024, to assess the applicant\u2019s intention to study in Australia ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Financial Capacity:** Applicants must provide evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other associated costs ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** Applicants must provide evidence of their English language proficiency through recognized tests such as IELTS, TOEFL, or PTE ([Upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/study-abroad/articles/interview-questions-for-australia-student-visa-/)).\n*   **Health Insurance:** Applicants must have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of their stay ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n*   **Age Requirement:** Students must be at least 6 years of age to apply for the student visa ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/australia-study-visa-processing-time/)).\n\n### Application Process\n\nThe application process for the Student Visa (Subclass 500) typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Obtain a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** Secure a CoE from a CRICOS-registered educational institution ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is mandatory for all student visa applications, replacing Letters of Offer ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n2.  **Prepare Required Documents:** Gather all necessary documents, including passport, CoE, evidence of financial capacity, English language proficiency test results, OSHC, and GTE/GS statement ([Upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/study-abroad/articles/interview-questions-for-australia-student-visa-/)).\n3.  **Lodge the Visa Application:** Submit the visa application online through the Department of Home Affairs website ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/australia-study-visa-processing-time/)).\n4.  **Attend an Interview (if required):** Some applicants may be required to attend an interview to assess their GTE/GS status and intentions ([Amber Student](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/a-guide-to-gte-in-australia)).\n5.  **Undergo Health Examinations:** Complete any required health examinations as specified by the Department of Home Affairs ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/australia-study-visa-processing-time/)).\n\n### Visa Conditions\n\nWhile holding a Student Visa (Subclass 500), students must comply with the following conditions ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)):\n\n*   **Maintain Enrolment:** Remain enrolled in a CRICOS-registered course.\n*   **Satisfactory Attendance and Progress:** Meet the academic performance and attendance requirements of the course.\n*   **Work Limitations:** Adhere to the work limitations of 48 hours per fortnight during study periods.\n*   **Health Insurance:** Maintain valid OSHC throughout the stay.\n*   **Update Details:** Notify the educational institution and the Department of Home Affairs of any changes to address or circumstances.\n\nFailure to comply with these conditions may result in visa cancellation ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement, which replaced the GTE requirement on March 23, 2024, is a critical aspect of the student visa assessment ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). It assesses the applicant's intention to study in Australia. This involves answering targeted questions about their studies, plans, and circumstances ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The Department of Home Affairs considers various factors, including previous study, employment history, ties to the home country, and economic situation ([Visa Help Services](https://www.visahelpservices.com.au/blogs/genuine-student-requirement/)).\n\n### Key Changes for 2025\n\nSeveral key changes have been introduced for the Student Visa (Subclass 500) in 2025:\n\n*   **Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is mandatory for all student visa applications, replacing Letters of Offer ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). This requires upfront tuition payments, and onshore applications without CoEs are invalid ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Cap on International Student Enrollments:** A cap of 270,000 new international student commencements will regulate enrollments ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **Introduction of the Core Skills Occupation List:** The introduction of the Core Skills Occupation List in 2025 could influence post-study plans, potentially affecting opportunities to transition to work visas in high-demand fields after graduation ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Processing Times\n\nVisa processing times can vary depending on demand, application completeness, and government priorities ([No Borders](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/australia-visa-rules-processing-times-for-2025/)). As of 2025, student visas generally take 4-8 weeks to process, although it may take longer during peak application periods ([No Borders](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/australia-visa-rules-processing-times-for-2025/)). According to Leverage Edu, as of January 1, 2024, 90% of higher education sector student visas are processed in 71 days ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/australia-study-visa-processing-time/)).\n\n### Factors Affecting Processing Time\n\nSeveral factors can affect the processing time of an Australian student visa ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/australia-study-visa-processing-time/)):\n\n*   Failure to submit necessary documents\n*   Response time to requests for more information\n*   Time taken for required checks\n*   Time taken by external agencies to provide information\n*   Number of places available for permanent visa applications\n*   Volume of applications\n*   Changes to ministerial directions\n\n### Tips for a Successful Application\n\nTo increase the chances of a successful student visa application, applicants should consider the following tips:\n\n*   **Start Early:** Begin the application process months in advance to secure a CoE in time ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Budget Accordingly:** Consider all upfront costs, including tuition fees required for the CoE and the application fee ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). The application fee is AUD 1,600 ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Choose Institutions Wisely:** Ensure that the institutions applied to can issue CoEs quickly once all enrollment requirements are met ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Provide Accurate Information:** Ensure all information provided in the application is accurate and truthful ([Jag Vimal](https://www.jagvimal.com.au/blog/genuine-temporary-entrant)).\n*   **Prepare for the Interview:** If required, prepare thoroughly for the visa interview by researching the university, course, and career prospects ([Upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/study-abroad/articles/interview-questions-for-australia-student-visa-/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Australian Student Visa (Subclass 500) remains a vital pathway for international students seeking quality education and opportunities in Australia. By understanding the eligibility criteria, application process, and visa conditions, prospective students can navigate the application process effectively. The recent changes for 2025, including the mandatory CoE and the cap on international student enrollments, underscore the importance of early preparation and careful planning. By adhering to the guidelines and seeking timely guidance from educational institutions, international students can realize their academic aspirations in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nAmber Student.

      "full_response": "## Report on Staying Updated and Advising Students on Changes in Australian International Education Legislation and Regulations\n\nThe Australian international education sector is undergoing significant changes in 2025, with new legislation and regulations impacting international students and education providers alike. To effectively advise prospective and current international students, it is crucial to stay updated on these evolving policies. This report examines various methods for keeping abreast of these changes, focusing on reliable sources and proactive strategies. Based on the information provided, consulting directly with migration experts and legal professionals appears to be the most effective way to stay updated and accurately advise students on the complex and evolving landscape of Australian international education legislation and regulations.\n\n### Methods for Staying Updated\n\nSeveral avenues exist for staying informed about the changes in Australian international education legislation and regulations. These include:\n\n1.  **Official Government Websites:** The Australian Department of Education and the Department of Home Affairs are primary sources of information. These websites provide updates on policy changes, visa requirements, and regulatory frameworks ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/changes-legislative-framework-overseas-students); [Australian Department of Home Affairs website](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/australia-student-visa-updates-5-key-policy-changes-for-international-education/)). Regularly monitoring these sites ensures access to the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n2.  **Education Provider Communications:** Universities and other educational institutions are directly affected by these changes and often provide updates to their staff and prospective students. Maintaining close contact with education providers and subscribing to their newsletters can provide timely information ([Noborders Law Group](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/2025-australian-student-visa-caps-key-changes-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n3.  **Professional Associations and Organizations:** Organizations like Universities Australia and IDP Education offer insights and updates on the international education sector. These entities often conduct seminars, webinars, and publish articles on relevant topics ([Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/); [IDP Education](https://www.idp.com/blog/australia-announces-changes-for-international-students/?lang=en)).\n\n4.  **News Outlets and Education-Specific Websites:** Websites such as *Educations.com*, *VisaVerge.com*, *Insider Guides*, and *GetGIS.org* provide news and analysis on changes in international education policy. While these sources can be helpful, it is essential to verify the information with official sources before advising students ([Educations.com](https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/australia-to-introduce-new-regulations-for-international-enrollments); [VisaVerge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/australia-student-visa-updates-5-key-policy-changes-for-international-education/); [Insider Guides](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/); [GetGIS.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-regulations-for-international-students-in-australia)).\n\n5.  **Migration Experts and Legal Professionals:** Consulting with registered migration agents and immigration lawyers is a reliable way to obtain accurate and personalized advice. These professionals are experts in interpreting and applying the latest regulations ([Noborders Law Group](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/major-changes-to-australian-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Key Changes in 2025\n\nSeveral key changes are being implemented in 2025 that advisors need to be aware of:\n\n1.  **Cap on International Student Enrollments:** A significant change is the introduction of a cap on international student enrollments, set at 270,000 students for 2025. This cap is designed to manage the increasing number of students and ensure a balanced expansion of the education sector ([Educations.com](https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/australia-to-introduce-new-regulations-for-international-enrollments); [Visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). Universities with adequate student housing may be able to increase their caps ([IDP Education](https://www.idp.com/blog/australia-announces-changes-for-international-students/?lang=en)).\n\n2.  **Increased Oversight for Education Agents:** New regulations require education providers to report detailed data on agent commissions and student transfers. This increased oversight aims to protect students from misleading practices and ensure agents act in their clients' best interests ([Educations.com](https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/australia-to-introduce-new-regulations-for-international-enrollments)).\n\n3.  **Ministerial Powers to Ensure Quality:** The Minister for Education has the authority to suspend or cancel courses that do not meet Australia's high standards or align with its future skills needs. This reform is a safeguard to ensure international students are enrolled in high-quality programs that provide real value ([Educations.com](https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/australia-to-introduce-new-regulations-for-international-enrollments)).\n\n4.  **Changes to Student Visa Requirements:** Several changes to student visa policies have been introduced, including increased proof of funds, a new Genuine Student test, and restrictions on onshore applications for temporary visa holders ([VisaVerge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/australia-student-visa-updates-5-key-policy-changes-for-international-education/); [GetGIS.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-regulations-for-international-students-in-australia); [Noborders Law Group](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/major-changes-to-australian-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n5.  **Certificate of Enrollment (CoE) Requirement:** A significant change is the requirement for a Certificate of Enrollment (CoE) before applying for a student visa. This ensures that applicants are genuinely enrolled in a course of study ([VisaVerge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/); [Noborders Law Group](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/major-changes-to-australian-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n6.  **Financial Requirements:** The financial requirements for student visa eligibility have been elevated. Applicants must demonstrate sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other costs ([VisaVerge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/); [GetGIS.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-regulations-for-international-students-in-australia)).\n\n### Advising Students Effectively\n\nTo provide effective advice to international students, the following strategies are recommended:\n\n1.  **Proactive Monitoring:** Regularly check official government websites, education provider communications, and professional association updates. Set up alerts and subscribe to newsletters to receive timely notifications of changes.\n\n2.  **Verification of Information:** Always verify information from news outlets and education-specific websites with official sources before advising students.\n\n3.  **Personalized Advice:** Recognize that each student's situation is unique. Provide personalized advice based on their specific circumstances, including their country of origin, intended course of study, and visa status.\n\n4.  **Early Preparation:** Encourage students to start the application process early, as the new regulations require additional steps, such as obtaining a CoE.\n\n5.  **Financial Planning:** Advise students to carefully plan their finances and ensure they have sufficient funds to meet the increased financial requirements.\n\n6.  **Consultation with Experts:** Recommend that students consult with registered migration agents and immigration lawyers for accurate and personalized advice.\n\n7.  **Understanding the Genuine Student Test:** Help students understand the requirements of the new Genuine Student test and prepare their applications accordingly.\n\n8.  **Awareness of Visa Hopping Restrictions:** Inform students about the restrictions on visa hopping and the importance of complying with visa conditions.\n\n### The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Framework\n\nThe ESOS framework is a critical component of Australia's international education system. It governs the registration process and obligations of registered international education providers, the Tuition Protection Service, and enforcement and compliance arrangements for education providers ([Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/Tourismandeducation/Interim_Report_-_Inquiry_into_Australias_International_Education_Sector/Chapter_5_-_Regulation_and_Integrity); [Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/)). The ESOS Act provides a legal framework to govern the delivery of education to overseas students on a student visa in Australia ([Universities Australia](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/international/legislation-and-regulation/)).\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code) sets nationally consistent standards for the delivery of courses to overseas students ([International Education, Australian Government](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Pages/RegulatoryinformationOld.aspx)). Education institutions must comply with the National Code to maintain their registration to provide education services to international students ([International Education, Australian Government](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Pages/RegulatoryinformationOld.aspx)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStaying updated on the evolving landscape of Australian international education legislation and regulations is essential for effectively advising prospective and current international students. While various methods exist for staying informed, consulting directly with migration experts and legal professionals appears to be the most reliable approach. These professionals possess the expertise to interpret and apply the latest regulations, ensuring that students receive accurate and personalized advice. By proactively monitoring official sources, verifying information, and recommending expert consultations, advisors can empower students to navigate the complexities of the Australian international education system successfully.\n\n### References\n\nDepartment of Education, Australian Government.

      "full_response": "# Refund Policies in Australian Institutions: Defining Health Reasons\n\nRefund policies are a critical aspect of institutional transparency and student welfare, particularly for international students in Australia. When an institution's policy states that all money is refundable if a student cannot commence studies due to health reasons, it is crucial to define what constitutes a valid \"health\" reason. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of potential health reasons that could warrant a refund, drawing from various Australian government and institutional sources. It will also address the necessary documentation and considerations for both the institution and the student.\n\n## Defining \"Health Reasons\" for Refund Eligibility\n\nA \"health reason\" that prevents a student from commencing studies can encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, both physical and mental. These reasons generally fall into the following categories:\n\n### 1. Medical Conditions\n\nMedical conditions include illnesses, injuries, or disabilities that significantly impair a student's ability to attend classes and fulfill course requirements. These conditions can be pre-existing, newly diagnosed, or a sudden exacerbation of a chronic issue ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **Serious Illness or Injury:** A severe illness requiring hospitalization or prolonged treatment that prevents the student from attending classes ([TAFESA](https://www.tafesa.edu.au/international/before-starting/int-policies-responsibilities/int-suspension)).\n    *   **Chronic Condition Exacerbation:** An unforeseen worsening of a previously well-managed condition, such as asthma, diabetes, or arthritis, rendering the student unable to continue studies ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n    *   **Newly Diagnosed Condition:** A medical condition only discovered after the census date that makes it impossible to complete studies ([Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/enrolment-timetables-fees/taking-a-break-from-study/supporting-documentation-for-withdrawal)).\n\n### 2. Mental Health Conditions\n\nMental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorders, can be equally debilitating and prevent a student from commencing or continuing their studies ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **Severe Anxiety or Depression:** Conditions that significantly impair a student's ability to concentrate, attend classes, or complete assignments.\n    *   **Traumatic Experiences:** Involvement in or witnessing an accident or crime that negatively impacts the student's capacity to study ([TAFESA](https://www.tafesa.edu.au/international/before-starting/int-policies-responsibilities/int-suspension)).\n    *   **Sudden Onset of Mental Health Issues:** The unexpected emergence of a mental health condition that prevents the student from functioning effectively in an academic environment.\n\n### 3. Health Emergencies\n\nHealth emergencies encompass sudden and unexpected medical situations that necessitate immediate attention and prevent the student from commencing studies ([Travelpander](https://travelpander.com/can-i-cancel-a-flight-and-get-a-refund-australia/)).\n\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **Sudden Hospitalization:** An unforeseen medical event requiring urgent hospital admission and treatment.\n    *   **Contagious Illness:** A highly contagious disease that poses a risk to public health and requires isolation, preventing the student from attending classes.\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\nTo substantiate a claim for a refund based on health reasons, students must provide independent and verifiable supporting documentation. The specific requirements may vary slightly between institutions, but generally include the following:\n\n### 1. Medical Certificate or Report\n\nA certificate or report from a registered medical or health practitioner is essential. The practitioner must be registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) or an equivalent overseas body ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)). The documentation should include:\n\n*   **Patient's Name:** Clear identification of the student.\n*   **Practitioner's Contact Details:** Including provider number for verification.\n*   **Date of Onset/Worsening:** Specific dates when the medical condition began or deteriorated.\n*   **Duration of Impact:** How long the condition is expected to affect the student's ability to study.\n*   **Impact on Studies:** A clear statement of how the condition prevents the student from meeting course requirements ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n\n### 2. Supporting Statements\n\nAdditional statements from counselors, wellbeing services, or other relevant professionals may strengthen the application, particularly for mental health-related claims ([Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/enrolment-timetables-fees/taking-a-break-from-study/supporting-documentation-for-withdrawal)).\n\n### 3. Official Translations\n\nIf the original documentation is not in English, an official translation must be provided along with the original document ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n\n## Institutional Considerations\n\nInstitutions must ensure their refund policies are transparent, easily accessible, and consistently applied. Key considerations include:\n\n### 1. Policy Clarity\n\nThe definition of \"health reasons\" should be clearly articulated in the refund policy to avoid ambiguity. Examples of acceptable conditions and documentation requirements should be provided.\n\n### 2. Application Process\n\nA streamlined and accessible application process is crucial. Students should be informed of the steps involved, required documentation, and expected processing times.\n\n### 3. Impartial Assessment\n\nApplications should be assessed impartially and consistently, based on the provided documentation and the institution's policy.\n\n### 4. Communication\n\nClear and timely communication with the student throughout the application process is essential. Students should be informed of the outcome and the reasons for the decision.\n\n### 5. Compliance with Australian Consumer Law (ACL)\n\nInstitutions must ensure their refund policies comply with the ACL, which provides consumer guarantees that services will be rendered with due care and skill ([Norton Rose Fulbright](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-au/knowledge/publications/b6fccf2e/is-your-refund-policy-immune-from-covid-19)). While institutions can have specific refund policies, they cannot mislead consumers or make false representations about their rights to a refund.\n\n## Circumstances Not Typically Considered \"Health Reasons\"\n\nIt is also important to define circumstances that would not typically be considered valid \"health reasons\" for a refund. These may include:\n\n*   **Minor or Short-Term Illnesses:** Conditions that do not significantly impair the student's ability to study or complete assessments ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n*   **Pre-Existing Conditions:** Conditions known before enrollment that do not unexpectedly worsen after the census date, unless there is a significant and unforeseen exacerbation ([Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/enrolment-timetables-fees/taking-a-break-from-study/supporting-documentation-for-withdrawal)).\n*   **Circumstances Within the Student's Control:** Situations that could have been reasonably avoided, such as failing to manage a pre-existing condition or neglecting to seek timely medical attention ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/late-withdrawal-due-to-special-circumstances)).\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has introduced unique considerations for refund policies. Students who were unable to commence studies due to travel restrictions or were forced to reduce their study load may be eligible for refunds or fee waivers under specific government initiatives ([OzStudies](https://www.ozstudies.com/blog/study-australia/student-and-work-and-holiday-visa-refund)). Institutions should be aware of these initiatives and ensure their policies align with government guidelines.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDefining \"health reasons\" in an institution's refund policy requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach. By considering a wide range of medical and mental health conditions, establishing clear documentation requirements, and ensuring policy transparency, institutions can effectively support students facing genuine health challenges. Compliance with Australian Consumer Law and awareness of government initiatives related to COVID-19 are also crucial for maintaining ethical and legal standards. This detailed approach ensures fairness and protects the rights of both the institution and the student.\n\n## References\n\nAustralian National University. (n.d.).

      "full_response": "## Work Rights for International Students in Australia on a Student Visa in 2025\n\nInternational students contribute significantly to Australia's economy and cultural diversity. A key aspect of their experience is the ability to work while studying, which helps offset living expenses and gain valuable work experience. However, these work rights are governed by specific regulations tied to the student visa (Subclass 500). As of March 3, 2025, the basic guidelines that describe the work rights students have while on a student visa in Australia are structured around limitations on work hours during study periods, the ability to work unlimited hours during breaks, and adherence to specific visa conditions. These regulations aim to ensure that students primarily focus on their education while still having the opportunity to support themselves financially ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/work-hours-limit-for-student-visa-holders-to-be-re-introduced)).\n\n### Core Regulations Governing Work Rights\n\nThe Australian government has established clear guidelines regarding the work rights of international students. These regulations are designed to balance the students' need for financial support with the primary purpose of their stay in Australia: education. The key aspects of these regulations include:\n\n1.  **Work Hour Limitations:** International students are generally permitted to work up to 48 hours per fortnight during their study periods ([Kansaz](https://www.kansaz.in/news/australia-student-visa-rules-to-change-work-restrictions-to-be-reintroduced)). This limit ensures that students dedicate sufficient time to their studies. A fortnight is defined as a 14-day period commencing on a Monday ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/work-rights-on-student-visa/)).\n\n2.  **Unlimited Work During Breaks:** During official school breaks or holiday periods, students can work unlimited hours ([Bright Future Education](https://brightfutureedu.com.au/work-limit-for-student-visa-in-australia/)). This provision allows students to maximize their earnings during these periods.\n\n3.  **Commencement of Employment:** Students are typically not allowed to commence employment until after the start date of their course ([Australia Migrate](https://www.australiamigrate.com/visa-news/does-a-student-visa-allow-you-to-work/)). This ensures that students are enrolled and actively participating in their studies before engaging in work.\n\n4.  **Course Progress:** Students must maintain satisfactory course progress and attendance to remain eligible to work ([Kansaz](https://www.kansaz.in/news/australia-student-visa-rules-to-change-work-restrictions-to-be-reintroduced)). Failure to meet these requirements can lead to visa cancellation.\n\n5.  **Visa Condition 8105:** Subclass 500 student visa holders must adhere to Condition 8105, which outlines the restrictions on working hours and commencement of employment ([Australia Migrate](https://www.australiamigrate.com/visa-news/does-a-student-visa-allow-you-to-work/)).\n\n### Exceptions to Work Hour Limitations\n\nWhile the 48-hour per fortnight limit is generally applicable, certain exceptions exist:\n\n1.  **Postgraduate Research Students:** Students enrolled in a master's degree by research or a doctoral degree may work unlimited hours once their course has commenced ([Bright Future Education](https://brightfutureedu.com.au/work-limit-for-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n2.  **Dependents of Postgraduate Students:** Dependents of students enrolled in master's or doctoral degrees may also work unlimited hours ([Bright Future Education](https://brightfutureedu.com.au/work-limit-for-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n3.  **Work Specified as a Course Requirement:** If work is a mandatory component of the course, such as an internship for a social work degree, these hours do not count towards the student visa work hour limit ([Australia Migrate](https://www.australiamigrate.com/visa-news/does-a-student-visa-allow-you-to-work/)).\n\n### Minimum Wage and Fair Work Compliance\n\nInternational students are entitled to the same workplace rights as any other worker in Australia, including the minimum wage. As of 2025, the minimum wage in Australia is AUD $23.23 per hour ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)). Students should be aware of their rights and ensure they are being paid fairly for their work.\n\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\nExceeding the allowed working hours or breaching other visa conditions can have serious consequences:\n\n1.  **Visa Breach:** Working more than 48 hours per fortnight during academic sessions constitutes a breach of the student visa conditions ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n2.  **Visa Cancellation:** Repeatedly exceeding work hours can lead to visa suspension or cancellation ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n3.  **Deportation:** In severe cases, students may be deported from Australia and banned from re-entry ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n4.  **Penalties Under Fair Work Laws:** Failure to comply with Fair Work laws can result in fines for employers and potential employment termination ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n### Balancing Work and Study\n\nSuccessfully balancing work and study requires careful planning and time management. Some helpful tips include:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Academics:** Ensure that work commitments do not negatively impact studies ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n2.  **Time Management:** Plan work hours around the academic schedule to avoid burnout ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n3.  **Stay Informed:** Keep up with any changes in working regulations or visa conditions by regularly visiting official government websites ([Settlement Service](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n### Recent Changes and Temporary Measures\n\nIt is important to note that the regulations governing student visa work rights have been subject to changes, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n1.  **Temporary Relaxation of Work Hours:** During the pandemic, the Australian government temporarily relaxed the restrictions on working hours for student visa holders to address workforce shortages, particularly in critical sectors such as aged care ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/work-rights-on-student-visa/)). However, these temporary measures have since been reviewed and largely discontinued.\n\n2.  **Reintroduction of Work Hour Limits:** As of July 1, 2023, work restrictions for most student visa holders were reintroduced, capped at 48 hours per fortnight ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/work-hours-limit-for-student-visa-holders-to-be-re-introduced)).\n\n### New Employment Protections\n\nIn addition to the regulations governing work hours, the Australian government has also introduced new laws to protect international students in the workforce. These laws enable international students to report workplace exploitation without risking their visa ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/tips-and-advice-for-students/new-employment-protections-for-international-students)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe work rights of international students in Australia on a student visa are governed by a set of regulations designed to balance the students' need for financial support with the primary purpose of their stay: education. As of March 3, 2025, these regulations include limitations on work hours during study periods, the ability to work unlimited hours during breaks, and adherence to specific visa conditions. While exceptions exist for postgraduate research students and those whose work is a mandatory component of their course, all students must comply with Fair Work laws and maintain satisfactory course progress. Staying informed about any changes to these regulations is crucial for international students to ensure they remain compliant and make the most of their study and work experience in Australia.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\nAustralia Migrate.

      "full_response": "## Understanding Student Visa Condition 8202 in Australia: A Comprehensive Report\n\nA student visa issued with condition 8202 in Australia carries significant implications for international students. This report delves into the specifics of condition 8202, its requirements, potential breaches, and the consequences for non-compliance. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this crucial visa condition for international students pursuing education in Australia.\n\n### What is Student Visa Condition 8202?\n\nCondition 8202 is a mandatory requirement imposed on most student visas (subclass 500) in Australia ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). It essentially ensures that international students are actively engaged in their studies and adhere to specific academic standards throughout their stay in the country ([intlstudents.com.au](https://intlstudents.com.au/student-visa-conditions-in-australia/)). Compliance with this condition is not merely a suggestion but a legal obligation, with potential ramifications for a student's current and future visa status ([intlstudents.com.au](https://intlstudents.com.au/student-visa-conditions-in-australia/)).\n\nSpecifically, condition 8202 mandates that student visa holders must:\n\n*   **Maintain Enrolment in a Registered Course:** Students must remain enrolled in a full-time registered course for the duration of their visa ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)). A registered course is one that is listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Maintain Enrolment at the Same or Higher AQF Level:** Students must maintain enrolment in a registered course that is at the same Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) level or higher than the course for which their student visa was initially granted ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)). Transferring to a lower AQF level without obtaining a new visa can lead to a breach of condition 8202 ([rsglawblog.com, 2019/05/14](https://rsglawblog.com/2019/05/14/student-visa-refusals-and-cancellations-transferring-to-a-lower-level-of-study/)).\n*   **Maintain Satisfactory Attendance:** Students are required to maintain satisfactory attendance in their course, as determined by their education provider ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)). While specific attendance requirements may vary between institutions, an attendance rate below 80% can raise concerns and potentially lead to visa cancellation ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n*   **Maintain Satisfactory Course Progress:** Students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress in their studies, as assessed by their education provider ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)). Failing to meet the required academic standards can result in a breach of condition 8202 ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n\n### Exceptions to Condition 8202\n\nWhile condition 8202 applies broadly, there are some exceptions:\n\n*   **Secondary Exchange Students:** Secondary exchange students are exempt from certain aspects of condition 8202 ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Foreign Affairs or Defence Sponsored Students:** Students sponsored by Foreign Affairs or Defence are also subject to modified requirements under condition 8202 ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Changing from AQF Level 10 to Level 9:** Students enrolled in a course at AQF level 10 (Doctoral Degree) can change their enrolment to a course at AQF level 9 (Master's Degree) without breaching condition 8202 ([rsglawblog.com, 2019/05/14](https://rsglawblog.com/2019/05/14/student-visa-refusals-and-cancellations-transferring-to-a-lower-level-of-study/)).\n\n### Breaching Condition 8202: What Constitutes a Violation?\n\nA breach of condition 8202 occurs when a student fails to meet any of the core requirements outlined above. Common scenarios that can lead to a breach include:\n\n*   **Changing Courses Without Approval:** Enrolling in a different course or changing universities without notifying the Department of Home Affairs can be a violation ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Dropping to a Lower AQF Level:** As mentioned earlier, transferring to a course at a lower AQF level generally constitutes a breach, unless the student obtains a new visa for the new course ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). For example, if a student was granted a visa for a Master of Business degree (AQF Level 9) and then changes to a Diploma of Management course (AQF Level 5), they would be in breach ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Failing to Meet Attendance Requirements:** Consistently poor attendance or attendance below the required threshold (often 80%) can trigger a breach ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n*   **Failing to Meet Academic Progress Requirements:** Unsatisfactory academic performance, such as failing subjects or not meeting the minimum GPA, can also lead to a breach ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n\n### Consequences of Breaching Condition 8202\n\nThe consequences of breaching condition 8202 can be severe, potentially jeopardizing a student's ability to continue their studies in Australia. The most significant consequence is visa cancellation ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** If the Department of Home Affairs determines that a student has breached condition 8202, they may cancel the student's visa ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). This means the student will be required to leave Australia.\n*   **Difficulty Obtaining Future Visas:** A visa cancellation due to a breach of condition 8202 can make it difficult for the student to obtain other visas in the future, including bridging visas or other substantive visas ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Impact on Future Applications:** Even if a student's visa is not cancelled, being reported for breaching condition 8202 can negatively impact future visa applications ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/breach-condition-82022c)).\n\n### The Role of Education Providers\n\nEducation providers play a crucial role in monitoring student compliance with condition 8202 ([educationtrainingcompliance.com.au](https://educationtrainingcompliance.com.au/reporting-student-visa-breach-on-prisms/)). They are required to:\n\n*   **Monitor Course Progress and Attendance:** Providers must monitor students' course progress and attendance to identify those who are at risk of breaching condition 8202 ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/breach-condition-82022c)).\n*   **Implement Intervention Strategies:** Before reporting a student for unsatisfactory course progress or attendance, providers must implement documented intervention strategies to assist the student in improving their performance ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/breach-condition-82022c)).\n*   **Notify Students of Intention to Report:** If a student continues to demonstrate unsatisfactory course progress or attendance despite intervention attempts, the provider must serve the student with a notice of their intention to report them to the Department of Home Affairs ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/breach-condition-82022c)).\n*   **Provide Access to Complaints and Appeals Processes:** Students must be advised of their right to access the provider's complaints and appeals process within 20 working days of receiving the notice of intention to report ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/guide-reporting-obligations-cricos-providers/breach-condition-82022c)).\n*   **Report Breaches to the Department of Home Affairs:** If the student does not improve their performance or chooses not to access the complaints and appeals process, the provider is obligated to report the breach to the Department of Home Affairs via the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) ([educationtrainingcompliance.com.au](https://educationtrainingcompliance.com.au/reporting-student-visa-breach-on-prisms/)).\n\n### Appealing a Decision to Cancel a Visa\n\nStudents who have their visas cancelled due to a breach of condition 8202 have avenues for appeal. They typically have 28 days to provide reasons for revoking the decision to cancel their visa ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) from the Department of Home Affairs ultimately decides whether a student has breached their visa condition ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). If revocation is not possible, students can pursue merits review and judicial review ([visafaq.com.au](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n\n### Maintaining Compliance: Tips for International Students\n\nTo avoid breaching condition 8202 and ensure a smooth academic journey in Australia, international students should:\n\n*   **Understand Visa Conditions:** Thoroughly understand all the conditions attached to their student visa, including condition 8202 ([istudywise.com](https://www.istudywise.com/breaching-visa-conditions-australia/)).\n*   **Maintain Full-Time Enrolment:** Ensure they are enrolled in a full-time registered course and maintain that enrolment throughout their studies ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)).\n*   **Attend Classes Regularly:** Attend all scheduled classes and maintain satisfactory attendance, as defined by their education provider ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)).\n*   **Strive for Academic Success:** Work diligently to achieve satisfactory academic progress in their studies ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)).\n*   **Communicate with Education Providers:** If they are struggling with their studies or attendance, communicate with their education provider and seek assistance ([educationtrainingcompliance.com.au](https://educationtrainingcompliance.com.au/reporting-student-visa-breach-on-prisms/)).\n*   **Notify Changes to Course or Institution:** If they wish to change courses or institutions, notify the Department of Home Affairs and obtain the necessary approvals ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Seek Professional Advice:** If they are unsure about any aspect of their visa conditions, seek advice from a registered migration agent or lawyer ([themigration.com.au, 2023/06/16](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCondition 8202 is a critical aspect of the Australian student visa program. It is designed to ensure that international students are genuinely pursuing their education and contributing to the integrity of the Australian education system. By understanding the requirements of condition 8202 and taking proactive steps to comply, international students can avoid potential visa issues and enjoy a successful and rewarding academic experience in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nAustralian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA).

      "full_response": "## Understanding Student Visa Condition 8533 in Australia: A Comprehensive Report\n\nIn Australia, a student visa is accompanied by several conditions that international students must adhere to throughout their stay. These conditions are in place to ensure a smooth and lawful experience, and failure to comply can lead to visa cancellation and other serious consequences ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)). Among these conditions, **Condition 8533** is particularly important, as it relates to informing the education provider of the student's residential address. This report will delve into the specifics of Condition 8533, its implications, and its significance for international students in Australia.\n\n### Condition 8533: Inform Provider of Address\n\nCondition 8533 mandates that international students in Australia must inform their education provider of their residential address ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)). This condition has two key components:\n\n1.  **Initial Notification:** If the student was outside Australia when their visa was granted, they must inform their education provider of their residential address within 7 days of arriving in Australia ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)).\n2.  **Change of Address Notification:** Students must notify their education provider of any change of address within 7 days of moving to a new residence ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/); [Overseas Students Australia, n.d.](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/student-visa-conditions/)).\n\nThis condition is in place to ensure that education providers can effectively communicate with their international students and provide them with necessary support and information.\n\n### Rationale Behind Condition 8533\n\nThe Australian Department of Home Affairs imposes Condition 8533 for several important reasons:\n\n*   **Communication:** Accurate address information allows education providers to communicate important information to students, such as course updates, changes to regulations, and emergency notifications.\n*   **Welfare:** Knowing where students live enables education providers to monitor their well-being and offer assistance if needed. This is particularly crucial for students under 18 years of age, for whom welfare arrangements are a key concern ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)).\n*   **Compliance:** By tracking student addresses, education providers can help ensure that students are complying with other visa conditions, such as maintaining enrollment and attending classes ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)).\n*   **Legal Obligation:** Adhering to visa conditions is a legal obligation, and failure to do so can have serious consequences ([IntlStudents, n.d.](https://intlstudents.com.au/student-visa-conditions-in-australia/)).\n\n### How to Comply with Condition 8533\n\nComplying with Condition 8533 is a straightforward process. Students can typically update their address information through their education provider's online portal or by contacting the provider's international student support services ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Some institutions may also require students to update their address in the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\nTo ensure compliance, students should:\n\n*   Record their arrival date in Australia.\n*   Update their address information within 7 days of arrival.\n*   Keep a record of their address updates, including the date and method of notification.\n*   Update their address information every time they move to a new residence, again within 7 days of the move ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Consequences of Non-Compliance\n\nFailure to comply with Condition 8533 can have serious consequences for international students. The Department of Home Affairs considers non-compliance with visa conditions to be a breach of the student's visa obligations ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)). This can lead to:\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** The most severe consequence of non-compliance is visa cancellation. If a student's visa is cancelled, they may be required to leave Australia ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)).\n*   **Difficulty Obtaining Future Visas:** Non-compliance with visa conditions can also make it more difficult to obtain future visas for Australia or other countries.\n*   **Impact on Education:** Visa cancellation can disrupt a student's education and prevent them from completing their course of study.\n\n### Other Relevant Visa Conditions\n\nWhile Condition 8533 is crucial, it is just one of many conditions that international students must adhere to. Other important conditions include:\n\n*   **Condition 8105: Work Restriction:** This condition limits the number of hours that students can work while their course is in session ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)). As of July 1, 2023, work hours are capped at 48 hours per fortnight during term time ([Monash Student Association, n.d.](https://monashstudentassociation.com.au/services/support-services/finance-advice/international-student-matters/student-visa-restrictions/)).\n*   **Condition 8202: Meet Course Requirements:** This condition requires students to maintain enrollment in a registered course, attend classes regularly, and make satisfactory academic progress ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)). Many institutions require at least 80% attendance ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Condition 8501: Maintain Adequate Health Insurance:** This condition requires students to maintain adequate health insurance throughout their stay in Australia, typically through Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)).\n*   **Condition 8516: Continue to Satisfy the Criteria for the Grant of the Visa:** This condition requires students to continue to meet the requirements that were in place when their visa was granted, such as having sufficient financial capacity to support their study and stay in Australia ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/); [Monash Student Association, n.d.](https://monashstudentassociation.com.au/services/support-services/finance-advice/international-student-matters/student-visa-restrictions/)).\n*   **Condition 8517: Maintain Adequate Arrangements for the Education of Your School-Age Dependents:** This condition applies to students who have school-age dependents in Australia and requires them to ensure that their dependents have access to adequate education ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)).\n*   **Condition 8532: Maintaining Welfare Arrangements for Minors:** This condition applies to students who are under 18 years of age and requires them to have appropriate accommodation and support arrangements in place ([EMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia, 2023](https://www.emcaustralia.com.au/student-visa-condition/)).\n\n### Recent Changes to Student Visa Regulations in 2025\n\nIt is important for international students to stay informed about any changes to student visa regulations. As of January 1, 2025, several key changes have been implemented, including:\n\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) Requirement:** Onshore student visa applications now require a CoE, replacing the previous Letter of Offer ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/); [LinkedIn, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/australia-student-visa-changes-key-updates-2025-trenity-consultants-qudxf/)). This means that students must pay their tuition fees upfront before applying for a visa.\n*   **Increased Financial Requirements:** International students must demonstrate a higher financial capacity to cover their tuition and living expenses ([VisaLiv, 2024](https://visaliv.com/news/australias-new-student-visa-rules-effective-january-2025)).\n*   **Enhanced English Proficiency Standards:** Applicants must meet more stringent English language proficiency criteria ([VisaLiv, 2024](https://visaliv.com/news/australias-new-student-visa-rules-effective-january-2025)).\n*   **Age Restrictions for Graduate Visas:** The Temporary Graduate visa scheme now excludes students over 35 years of age ([VisaLiv, 2024](https://visaliv.com/news/australias-new-student-visa-rules-effective-january-2025)).\n\nThese changes are designed to enhance the integrity of the international education system and ensure that only genuine students are granted visas ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCondition 8533 is a vital component of the Australian student visa program. It requires international students to inform their education provider of their residential address within specified timeframes. Compliance with this condition is essential for effective communication, student welfare, and overall visa compliance. Failure to comply can lead to serious consequences, including visa cancellation. International students should familiarize themselves with Condition 8533 and all other relevant visa conditions to ensure a successful and lawful stay in Australia. Furthermore, staying updated on the latest changes to student visa regulations, such as the 2025 updates, is crucial for maintaining compliance and navigating the Australian education system effectively.\n\n### References\n\nEMC-Education & Migration Centre Australia.

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the query, adhering to all specified guidelines:\n\n### Report: International Student Course Transfer Policy in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAustralia's international education sector is governed by specific regulations designed to ensure the quality of education and the integrity of the student visa program. A key aspect of these regulations is the policy regarding international students transferring between education providers. This report examines the conditions under which an international student can change providers, particularly focusing on students enrolled in packaged courses that include an English Language Intensive Course for Overseas Students (ELICOS) program followed by a bachelor's degree. The report will provide a detailed analysis of the \"6-month rule,\" its implications, and the procedures students must follow to comply with Australian immigration law.\n\n**The \"6-Month Rule\" and Its Implications**\n\nAccording to Australian immigration law, international students are generally required to complete at least six months of their principal course before being eligible to transfer to another education provider ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)). The principal course is defined as the main course of study for which the student visa was issued, typically the final course in a series of packaged courses ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\nFor a student on a package of courses with the principal course being a bachelor's degree, and the first course being an ELICOS program, the six-month requirement applies to the bachelor's degree, not the ELICOS program. This means that the student must complete six calendar months from the commencement date of their bachelor's degree before they can freely transfer to another provider ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**Detailed Analysis of the Scenario**\n\nLet's consider a scenario where an international student is enrolled in a packaged course:\n\n1.  **ELICOS Program:** 20 weeks (approximately 5 months)\n2.  **Bachelor's Degree:** 3 years\n\nIn this case, the ELICOS program is a prerequisite to the bachelor's degree. The six-month rule applies to the bachelor's degree. Once the student has completed six months of their bachelor's degree, they are eligible to transfer to another provider, subject to certain conditions ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**Conditions for Transfer After Six Months**\n\nAfter completing six months of the principal course (bachelor's degree), the student can change providers, but they must notify the Department of Home Affairs (DOHA) of their intention to do so ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**Transferring Before Completing Six Months**\n\nIf a student wishes to transfer before completing six months of their principal course, they must obtain a release from their current education provider ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)). A release is a formal permission granted by the provider allowing the student to enroll in another institution before the six-month period has elapsed.\n\nHowever, the provider is not obligated to grant a release, and they may refuse if they believe the transfer is not in the student's best interest or does not align with the student's original study plan ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**Exceptional Circumstances for Early Transfer**\n\nEven if the six-month requirement is not met, a student may be able to transfer without a release in certain exceptional circumstances ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)):\n\n*   **Provider Ceases to Be CRICOS Registered:** If the current provider or the course in which the student is enrolled ceases to be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS), the student can transfer without a release.\n*   **Sanctions Imposed on Provider:** If the provider has had sanctions imposed on its registration by the ESOS agency that prevent the student from continuing their course, a release is not required.\n*   **Government Sponsorship:** If the student is sponsored by a government, and the sponsoring government considers the change to be in the student's best interest and provides written support for the change, a release may not be necessary.\n*   **Appeal Outcome:** If an appeal (internal or external) on another matter results in a decision or recommendation to release the student, they may be able to transfer.\n\n**Lower AQF Level Courses**\n\nIt is crucial to note that if an international student wants to transfer to a course at a lower Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) level (e.g., from a master's to a bachelor's degree), they are required to apply for a new student visa ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)). This is because the original visa was granted based on the student's intention to pursue a higher-level qualification.\n\n**Impact on Visa Conditions**\n\nWhen a student transfers, it is essential to ensure that they continue to meet all visa conditions. These conditions include maintaining satisfactory attendance and progress in their course of study ([Immigration World, n.d](https://www.immigrationworld.com/australia/8-types-australia-student-visa/)). Failure to comply with these conditions can lead to visa cancellation.\n\n**ELICOS Programs in Detail**\n\nELICOS programs are designed to help international students improve their English language skills before commencing further studies or for general purposes ([Education ONE, 2024](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/elicos-program-in-australia/)). These programs cover various aspects of English, including speaking, listening, reading, and writing ([Education ONE, 2024](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/elicos-program-in-australia/)).\n\n**Types of ELICOS Courses**\n\nThere are several types of ELICOS courses available, each catering to different needs and goals ([Leap Scholar, n.d](https://leapscholar.com/blog/all-about-elicos-australia-fees-courses-requirements/)):\n\n*   **General English:** Focuses on improving everyday communication skills.\n*   **English for Academic Purposes (EAP):** Prepares students for academic studies at Australian universities.\n*   **English for Specific Purposes (ESP):** Tailored for specific industries or fields, such as hospitality or business.\n*   **Exam Preparation:** Focuses on preparing students for English proficiency tests like IELTS or TOEFL.\n\n**ELICOS Visa Requirements**\n\nTo study an ELICOS program in Australia, international students typically need a student visa (subclass 500) ([Education ONE, 2024](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/elicos-program-in-australia/)). However, depending on the duration of the course and the student's circumstances, other visas such as visitor visas or working holiday visas may be sufficient ([Education ONE, 2024](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/elicos-program-in-australia/)).\n\n**CRICOS Registration**\n\nIt is essential to ensure that the ELICOS course and the education provider are registered with CRICOS ([ASQA, n.d](https://www.asqa.gov.au/resources/faqs/cricoselicos-compliance)). This registration ensures that the course meets the required standards and that the provider is authorized to offer courses to international students on student visas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, if an international student is on a package of courses with the principal course being a bachelor's degree, they are not generally able to transfer to another provider after completing six months of their ELICOS program. The six-month rule applies to the bachelor's degree itself. After completing six months of the bachelor's degree, the student can transfer, provided they notify the Department of Home Affairs and continue to meet all visa conditions.\n\nStudents should carefully consider their options and seek advice from education specialists or migration agents to ensure they comply with all relevant regulations and make informed decisions about their study pathway in Australia ([Australia Visa, 2019](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**References**\n\nAustralia Visa.

For international students in Australia, this achievement opens several pathways, each with its own set of opportunities and considerations. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the options available to a student who has completed a three-year Bachelor's degree in Australia as of March 3, 2025. The analysis will cover further education, work opportunities, visa options, and other relevant factors, drawing upon recent data and reports to provide a well-informed perspective.\n\n**Further Education**\n\nOne of the most common options for graduates is to pursue further education. Australia offers a range of postgraduate programs that can enhance a graduate's skills and knowledge, leading to better career prospects ([Overseas Students Australia](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/options-after-graduation-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Master's Degree:** A Master's degree is a popular choice, typically requiring one to two years of study. These programs are designed for students seeking advanced knowledge in their chosen field and can be coursework-based, research-based, or professional ([themigrant.au](https://themigrant.au/everything-international-students-need-to-know-in-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)). Completing a Master's degree can significantly improve job market prospects, especially when returning to one's home country ([aaseducation.com.au](https://aaseducation.com.au/honours-degree-or-master-degree-after-graduating-from-my-bachelor-degree/)).\n\n*   **Honours Degree:** An Honours degree involves an additional year of study after the Bachelor's degree. It is highly regarded in academia and the Australian job market ([aaseducation.com.au](https://aaseducation.com.au/honours-degree-or-master-degree-after-graduating-from-my-bachelor-degree/)). An Honours degree often includes research components and is a pathway to a Ph.D. program ([aaseducation.com.au](https://aaseducation.com.au/honours-degree-or-master-degree-after-graduating-from-my-bachelor-degree/)). It is particularly useful for those seeking careers requiring specific licenses, such as engineering ([aaseducation.com.au](https://aaseducation.com.au/honours-degree-or-master-degree-after-graduating-from-my-bachelor-degree/)).\n\n*   **Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy):** For students interested in research and academia, a Ph.D. is the highest level of academic qualification. It typically takes three to four years to complete and focuses on original research that contributes new knowledge to a field ([themigrant.au](https://themigrant.au/everything-international-students-need-to-know-in-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)).\n\n**Work Opportunities**\n\nAustralia's strong economy and diverse industries offer numerous career opportunities for international graduates ([msmunify.com](https://www.msmunify.com/study-in-australia/career-opportunities/)).\n\n*   **Post-Study Work Visa (Temporary Graduate Visa, Subclass 485):** This visa allows international students to stay and work in Australia after completing their studies. The duration of the visa can be up to four years, depending on the qualification level and the region where the studies were undertaken ([global-opportunities.net](https://www.global-opportunities.net/blogs/intakes-in-australia/)). However, recent changes to the post-study work rights (PSWR) may limit the visa duration to two or three years for many graduates ([macrobusiness.com.au](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/12/international-students-left-unemployed-and-underemployed/)).\n\n*   **Skilled Migration Program:** If the graduate's field of study is on the skilled occupation list, they may be eligible to apply for permanent residency through the skilled migration program ([overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/options-after-graduation-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Employer Sponsorship:** An Australian employer may sponsor a graduate for a new visa, allowing them to work in Australia ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/work-in-australia/work-after-graduating)).\n\n**Challenges in the Job Market**\n\nDespite the opportunities, international graduates face challenges in the Australian job market. Recent data indicates that a significant percentage of international graduates are employed in low-skilled jobs.\n\n*   A 2023 analysis revealed that 51% of international student graduates with a Bachelor's degree were working in Level 4 or 5 jobs (e.g., bar staff, waiters, cleaners) three years after graduation ([macrobusiness.com.au](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/12/international-graduates-dominate-australias-working-poor/)).\n\n*   The Graduate Outcomes Survey (GOS) consistently shows that international graduates have lower employment rates, participation rates, and median earnings compared to domestic graduates ([macrobusiness.com.au](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/12/international-students-left-unemployed-and-underemployed/)).\n\n*   Graduates from major source countries like China, India, and Nepal often have poorer labor market outcomes ([macrobusiness.com.au](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/12/international-students-left-unemployed-and-underemployed/)).\n\n**Visa Options and Requirements**\n\nUnderstanding visa options is crucial for international students planning to stay in Australia after graduation.\n\n*   **Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485):** This visa has different streams, including the Post-Study Work stream, which is relevant for Bachelor's degree graduates ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/work-in-australia/work-after-graduating)). Eligibility criteria and visa durations vary, and it's essential to check the latest requirements from the Department of Home Affairs ([overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/options-after-graduation-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Skilled Visas:** Graduates with skills in demand may apply for skilled independent or sponsored visas. This often requires a skills assessment and meeting specific points-based criteria ([overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/options-after-graduation-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Employer-Sponsored Visas:** If a graduate secures employment with an Australian company, the employer can sponsor them for a visa, such as the Temporary Skill Shortage visa (subclass 482) or the Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186) ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/work-in-australia/work-after-graduating)).\n\n**Financial Considerations**\n\nStudying and living in Australia involves significant costs. Graduates need to consider these financial aspects when planning their next steps.\n\n*   **Tuition Fees:** Tuition fees for international students vary depending on the course and university. Bachelor's degrees can range from AUD 9,000 to AUD 95,000 per year ([msmunify.com](https://www.msmunify.com/study-in-australia/cost-of-studying/)).\n\n*   **Living Expenses:** The annual cost of living in Australia is approximately AUD 35,000, covering accommodation, food, transport, and other expenses ([studyin-australia.com](https://www.studyin-australia.com/study-guide/cost-of-studying-in-australia-for-international-students/)). Cities like Sydney and Melbourne are generally more expensive than Adelaide or Perth ([studyin-australia.com](https://www.studyin-australia.com/study-guide/cost-of-studying-in-australia-for-international-students/)).\n\n*   **Scholarships and Financial Aid:** Many Australian universities offer scholarships specifically for international students. The Australian government also supports international students through programs like the Australia Awards ([global-opportunities.net](https://www.global-opportunities.net/blogs/intakes-in-australia/)). The Australia Awards Scholarship Bachelor provides full tuition fees, accommodation expenses, textbooks, return air travel, and health cover ([wsscholar4u.com](https://wsscholar4u.com/australia-awards-scholarship-bachelor-2025-2026/)).\n\n**Accreditation and Industry Connections**\n\nAccreditation and industry connections are vital for enhancing employment prospects.\n\n*   **Accreditation:** Ensure that the degree is accredited by relevant professional bodies or industry associations, especially in fields requiring certification, such as engineering, accounting, or healthcare ([themigrant.au](https://themigrant.au/everything-international-students-need-to-know-in-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)).\n\n*   **Industry Connections:** Many Australian universities have strong partnerships with businesses and organizations, providing students with valuable internship opportunities and practical experience ([themigrant.au](https://themigrant.au/everything-international-students-need-to-know-in-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)).\n\n**Cultural and Lifestyle Factors**\n\nAustralia is known for its multicultural environment and high quality of life, which are significant attractions for international students ([global-opportunities.net](https://www.global-opportunities.net/blogs/intakes-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Cultural Diversity:** Australia's diverse and welcoming culture offers international students a chance to connect with peers from all over the world ([themigrant.au](https://themigrant.au/everything-international-students-need-to-know-in-studying-in-australia-in-2025/)).\n\n*   **Quality of Life:** Cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth are known for their excellent public transport, healthcare, and overall safety, making them ideal places to live and study ([global-opportunities.net](https://www.global-opportunities.net/blogs/intakes-in-australia/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor a student who has completed a three-year Bachelor's degree in Australia, several viable options exist. Pursuing further education, such as a Master's or Honours degree, can enhance academic and career prospects. Work opportunities are available through post-study work visas, skilled migration programs, and employer sponsorships, although challenges in the job market persist, with many graduates facing underemployment. Careful consideration of visa requirements, financial aspects, accreditation, and industry connections is essential for making informed decisions. Despite the challenges, Australia remains a popular destination for international students due to its high-quality education, multicultural environment, and opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\n**References**\n\n*   AAS Education & Migration.

      "full_response": "## Responsibility for Updating Student Address Information in Australia: A Detailed Report\n\nThe question at hand concerns an 18-year-old international student in Australia who has moved from a homestay to an apartment. The core issue is determining whose responsibility it is to ensure that the education provider has the student's current address. Based on the provided information and relevant Australian regulations, this report will analyze the responsibilities of the student, the education provider, and any other relevant parties.\n\n### Student Responsibilities\n\nThe primary responsibility for providing and updating address information lies with the student. Several sources explicitly state this obligation, particularly for international students on student visas.\n\n*   **Visa Condition:** A condition of the student visa requires students to notify their education provider of their residential address within seven days of arriving in Australia or changing their address ([Sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/update-personal-information.html)).\n*   **University Requirements:** Universities like Murdoch University and La Trobe University require international students to notify them of their Australian residential address within seven days of arrival and whenever the address changes ([MyAnswers.custhelp.com](https://myanswers.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/697/~/notifying-department-of-home-affairs-of-changes-to-my-address), [Latrobe-current.custhelp.com](https://latrobe-current.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3242)). This information is typically updated through the university's online student portal. For example, the University of Sydney uses \"Sydney Student\" for this purpose ([Sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/update-personal-information.html)).\n*   **TAFE NSW:** TAFE NSW also emphasizes the responsibility of international students to inform them if they change their address ([TAFENSW.edu.au](https://www.tafensw.edu.au/study/support-services/rights-and-responsibilities)).\n*   **Australian National University (ANU):** ANU requires students to notify them of their Australian address within 7 days of arriving or changing their address through ISIS ([ANU.edu.au](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/information-for-international-student-visa-holders-studying-in-australia)).\n\nThis requirement is not merely a suggestion; it is a mandatory condition tied to the student's visa. Failure to comply can lead to serious consequences, including visa cancellation ([Deakin.edu.au](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/new-students/new-international-students-guide/life-in-australia/your-rights-and-responsibilities)).\n\n### Education Provider Responsibilities\n\nWhile the student bears the primary responsibility, education providers also have crucial obligations related to student address information.\n\n*   **Record Keeping:** Under Section 21(2) of the *Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act*, providers are required to keep records of each accepted student's current residential address, as supplied by the student ([Internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD3.aspx)).\n*   **Regular Confirmation:** Providers must confirm with the student in writing every six months that their contact details, including their residential address, are still correct and update the records accordingly ([Education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   **Notification Obligation:** Providers must advise students of their obligation to notify the provider of any address changes while enrolled in the course ([Internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD3.aspx)). This is often included in the written agreement between the provider and the student.\n*   **PRISMS Updates:** Education providers are required to update the student\u2019s residential address in PRISMS (Provider Registration and International Student Management System) ([Englishaustralia.com.au](https://www.englishaustralia.com.au/news/dha-provider-update-student-visa-program), [Internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD3.aspx)).These obligations are part of the *National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018* (National Code 2018), which sets nationally consistent standards for the delivery of courses to overseas students ([Education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)). Compliance with the National Code is essential for maintaining CRICOS (Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students) registration, which is required to offer courses to international students ([Internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/regulatory-information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx)).\n\n### Department of Home Affairs (DHA)\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) also plays a role in ensuring that student information is accurate.\n\n*   **Communication:** The DHA might need to contact students regarding their visa application, renewal process, or other important updates. An outdated address could lead to missed communication and potentially delay the application ([Migrationexpert.com.au](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/updating-address-how-to-notify-immigration/)).\n*   **Delivery of Documents:** The DHA may send crucial documents like visas, grant letters, or notifications via mail. An incorrect address could mean these documents get lost or reach the student late ([Migrationexpert.com.au](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/updating-address-how-to-notify-immigration/)).\n*   **Compliance:** As a visa holder, students must keep the DHA informed of any changes in their circumstances to avoid being considered in breach of their visa conditions ([Migrationexpert.com.au](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/updating-address-how-to-notify-immigration/)).\n\nStudents can update their address information with the DHA through ImmiAccount or by using Form 929 ([Migrationexpert.com.au](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/updating-address-how-to-notify-immigration/)).\n\n### Education Agents\n\nEducation agents can play a role in informing students of their responsibilities, but the ultimate responsibility lies with the student. The *Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024* aims to better regulate the activities of education agents, including preventing them from poaching students and shifting them to cheaper courses ([Ministers.education.gov.au](https://ministers.education.gov.au/clare/education-services-overseas-students-amendment-quality-and-integrity-bill-2024)).\n\n### Welfare Arrangements for Under 18 Students\n\nGiven that the student in question is 18 years old, specific welfare arrangements are not mandated by the DHA. However, when a student is under 18, the education provider typically has additional responsibilities for approving accommodation, support, and general welfare arrangements ([TAFENSW.edu.au](https://www.tafensw.edu.au/study/support-services/rights-and-responsibilities)). Since the student is now 18, she is considered an adult, and the responsibility for her welfare rests primarily with herself.\n\n### Analysis and Opinion\n\nBased on the information provided, it is unequivocally the student's responsibility to ensure that the education provider has her current address. While the education provider has a duty to maintain accurate records and remind students of their obligations, the onus is on the student to proactively provide and update their address information. This is a critical requirement linked to their student visa and compliance with Australian regulations.\n\nThe education provider should have systems in place to facilitate address updates and regularly confirm the accuracy of student information. However, the student cannot rely solely on the provider to ensure compliance. She must take the initiative to update her address through the designated channels, such as the university's online portal.\n\nThe fact that the student has moved from a homestay to an apartment does not alter her responsibility. Regardless of her living arrangements, she is obligated to inform her education provider of her current residential address.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while education providers and the Department of Home Affairs have roles in maintaining accurate student information, the primary responsibility for ensuring that the education provider has the current address of the 18-year-old student rests firmly with the student herself. Failure to fulfill this responsibility can have significant consequences for her visa status and her ability to study in Australia.\n\n### References\n\n*   [ANU.edu.au](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/information-for-international-student-visa-holders-studying-in-australia)\n    Australian National University.

      "full_response": "## Australian Student Visa Requirements: Identifying Unnecessary Documentation for Applications in 2025\n\nThe Australian government has implemented several changes to its student visa application process, effective January 1, 2025, aimed at ensuring visa integrity and attracting genuine international students ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). These changes necessitate a clear understanding of the updated requirements for prospective students. Based on the provided information, a \"Letter of Offer\" is no longer a generally accepted document for student visa applications.\n\n### The Shift from Letters of Offer to Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)\n\nPrior to 2025, a Letter of Offer from an Australian educational institution was often accepted as initial proof of admission when lodging a student visa application. However, as of January 1, 2025, the Department of Home Affairs mandates a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for all student visa applications submitted within Australia ([GetGIS, 2024](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)). This change aligns the evidence requirements for both onshore and offshore student visa applications, ensuring a more consistent and rigorous process.\n\n#### Implications of the CoE Requirement\n\nThe mandatory CoE requirement has several implications for student visa applicants:\n\n1.  **Invalid Applications:** Applications submitted without a CoE will be deemed invalid and will not be processed ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). This underscores the importance of securing a CoE before lodging a visa application.\n2.  **Financial Commitment:** Obtaining a CoE typically requires upfront tuition fee payments ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). This necessitates careful financial planning and preparation on the part of the applicant.\n3.  **Timely Preparation:** The additional step of obtaining a CoE makes early preparation more critical than ever ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Applicants need to start the application process months in advance to secure their CoE in time.\n4.  **Stronger Commitment:** Providing a CoE at the time of application demonstrates a stronger commitment by students to their intended institution, offering greater certainty to Australia's international education sector ([GetGIS, 2024](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)).\n\n#### Steps to Obtain a CoE\n\nTo obtain a CoE, applicants must:\n\n1.  Secure admission to an Australian educational institution.\n2.  Accept the offer of admission and pay the required tuition fees.\n3.  Receive a CoE from the institution ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\n### General Requirements for an Australian Student Visa in 2025\n\nWhile a Letter of Offer is no longer a standard requirement, several other documents and criteria remain essential for a successful student visa application. These include:\n\n1.  **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement:** Applicants must demonstrate a genuine intention to study in Australia and that their education will benefit their future prospects ([Leverage Edu, 2024](https://leverageedu.com/learn/gte-to-study-in-australia/)). This involves providing details of current circumstances, academic goals, and the value of the intended course of study.\n2.  **Financial Capacity:** Applicants must prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living costs, and travel expenses ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). As of May 10, 2024, the minimum required funds for living expenses are AUD 29,710 per year ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/acceptable-source-of-funds-for-student-visa-australia/)). Acceptable evidence includes bank statements, education loans, and scholarships ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n3.  **English Language Proficiency:** Applicants must demonstrate adequate English language skills through tests like IELTS, TOEFL iBT, or PTE Academic ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The minimum IELTS score for student visas increased to 6.0 in 2024 ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n4.  **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** Applicants must have valid OSHC for the entire duration of their stay in Australia ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n5.  **Health and Character Checks:** Applicants must meet health and character requirements, which may involve medical examinations and police certificates ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Financial Requirements in Detail\n\nDemonstrating sufficient financial capacity is a critical aspect of the student visa application. The Department of Home Affairs requires applicants to provide evidence of funds to cover:\n\n*   **Tuition Fees:** Evidence of payment or sufficient funds to cover the first year's tuition, less any deposit already paid ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Living Costs:** AUD 29,710 per year as of May 10, 2024 ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/acceptable-source-of-funds-for-student-visa-australia/)). This figure is set to reflect 75% of the national minimum wage, ensuring a basic standard of living ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Travel Costs:** Estimated at AUD 2,000 for applications from outside Australia and AUD 1,000 for onshore applications ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Schooling Costs (if applicable):** An additional annual amount of AUD 13,502 per child for schooling, unless exempt (e.g., for PhD students or Commonwealth scholarship recipients) ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\nAcceptable forms of evidence include:\n\n*   Bank statements showing funds held for at least 3 consecutive months before application ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   Letters of scholarship, sponsorship, or financial support from government, education providers, or international organizations ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   Evidence of educational loans, including terms and evidence of disbursement ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   Proof of personal or parental income of at least AUD 87,856 with family members, in the 12 months before application ([VisaEnvoy, n.d.](https://visaenvoy.com/acceptable-source-of-funds-for-student-visa-australia/)).\n\n### Student Dependent Visas\n\nInternational students may also bring their spouse and dependent children to Australia under a Student Dependent Visa ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)). To apply for this visa, dependents must provide:\n\n*   Completed application form (Form 157A for each dependent) ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Recent passport-sized photographs ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Certified copies of the bio-data pages for the primary applicant and all dependents ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Proof of relationship (marriage certificate or evidence of de facto relationship for spouse; birth certificates for children) ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Financial evidence to demonstrate sufficient funds to support all dependents ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Medical examination forms (Forms 26 and 160) ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Valid electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (eCOE) for the primary visa holder ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n*   Completed Form 919 (Nomination of Student Dependents) ([My New Australian Life, n.d.](https://mynewaustralianlife.com/visa/student-dependent-visa-checklist-for-2025-spouses-and-children/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while a Letter of Offer was previously accepted, it is no longer a generally required document for Australian student visa applications in 2025. The key document now required is the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), demonstrating a more concrete commitment to studying in Australia. Applicants must also meet the Genuine Student (GS) requirement, provide evidence of financial capacity, demonstrate English language proficiency, obtain OSHC, and satisfy health and character checks. Understanding these updated requirements is crucial for a smooth and successful student visa application process.\n\n### References\n\nAdmission Ac Blog. (2025, January 5).

      "full_response": "## Extending an Australian Student Visa: A Comprehensive Guide for Students Facing Academic Challenges\n\nWhen an international student encounters unforeseen circumstances that impede their academic progress, such as illness, it's crucial to provide them with accurate and comprehensive guidance regarding their visa options. In the scenario presented, a student enrolled in a three-year Bachelor of Arts program in Australia has experienced a four-week hospitalization during her final semester, leading to concerns about her ability to complete the program within the original timeframe. In this report, I will inform the student that she will need to apply for a student visa extension. This report will outline the steps involved in extending her student visa, the requirements she must meet, and other relevant considerations.\n\n### Understanding the Need for a Visa Extension\n\nThe primary reason for extending a student visa is to allow international students to complete their studies when unforeseen circumstances cause delays ([Lynx Global](https://lynxglobal.com.au/australia-student-visa-extension/)). In this case, the student's hospitalization has disrupted her academic schedule, making it necessary to extend her stay to fulfill the course requirements. It's important to emphasize that Australia does not offer automatic extensions for student visas ([e-LHR](https://e-lhr.com/how-to-extend-your-australian-student-visa-a-step-by-step-guide/)). Instead, students must apply for a new student visa (Subclass 500) to continue their studies legally ([VisaFast](https://www.visafast.com.au/blog/student-visa-7/student-visa-extension-australia-23)).\n\n### Eligibility Criteria for a Student Visa Extension\n\nTo be eligible for a student visa extension, the student must meet several criteria ([LegalFinda](https://legalfinda.com.au/blog/extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-a-complete-guide-for-foreign-students)):\n\n1.  **Enrollment in a Registered Course:** The student must be enrolled in a full-time, registered course of study in Australia. In this case, she will need to re-enroll for an additional semester to complete her Bachelor of Arts program.\n2.  **Good Academic Standing:** The student must maintain satisfactory academic progress with her educational institution. While her hospitalization may have affected her recent performance, she should demonstrate a commitment to completing her studies successfully.\n3.  **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** The student must possess valid OSHC for the entire duration of the extended visa period. This is a mandatory requirement for all international students in Australia ([Study Online Australia](https://www.studyonlineaustralia.com.au/blog/student-visa-oshc-length-international-student-australia)).\n4.  **Financial Capacity:** The student must demonstrate sufficient financial resources to support herself during the extended stay. This includes covering tuition fees, living expenses, and other associated costs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process for Extending the Student Visa\n\nThe student should be informed of the following steps to extend her student visa ([IStudentPlus](https://www.istudentplus.com/how-to-extend-your-australian-student-visa/)):\n\n1.  **Gather Necessary Documents:**\n    *   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** Obtain a new CoE from the university for the additional semester. This document confirms the student's enrollment in the registered course ([UNSW](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/coe)).\n    *   **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** Ensure that the OSHC is valid for the entire duration of the new visa. Extend the health cover if necessary.\n    *   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) Statement:** Prepare a GTE statement explaining the reasons for needing an extension and outlining future plans. This statement is crucial for the application's success. Note that the Genuine Student (GS) requirement has replaced the GTE requirement as of March 23, 2024, to assess the applicant\u2019s intention to study in Australia ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n    *   **Financial Evidence:** Provide evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other costs.\n    *   **Passport:** A valid passport is required for the visa application ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension/)).\n    *   **Academic Transcripts:** Provide academic transcripts and evidence of successful completion of courses ([VisaFast](https://www.visafast.com.au/blog/student-visa-7/student-visa-extension-australia-23)).\n    *   **Other Documents:** A certified copy of the birth certificate, national ID card, marriage certificate (if applicable), and parental authorization if under 18 years old may be required.\n2.  **Submit an Online Application:**\n    *   Log in to ImmiAccount on the Department of Home Affairs website.\n    *   Fill out the application form for a visa extension (Subclass 500).\n    *   Upload all required documents.\n3.  **Pay the Visa Fee:**\n    *   Pay the applicable visa extension fee through the online portal. As of July 1, 2024, the cost of a student visa extension (Subclass 500) is AUD 1,600 ([VisaFast](https://www.visafast.com.au/blog/student-visa-7/student-visa-extension-australia-23)).\n    *   Keep the receipt as proof of payment.\n4.  **Wait for a Decision:**\n    *   After submitting the application, the student will receive an acknowledgment letter.\n    *   The processing time varies, so be patient while waiting for a decision. Medical exam findings take roughly four weeks to process ([DMS Migration](https://www.dmsmigration.com/australian-student-visa-processing-time-after-medical/)).\n5.  **Receive the Visa Grant:**\n    *   Once the visa is granted, the student will receive a notification.\n    *   Ensure that the student understands any conditions attached to the extended visa.\n\n### Addressing Potential Challenges\n\nThe student should also be aware of potential challenges and how to address them:\n\n*   **Visa Expiry During Processing:** If the current visa expires while the application is being processed, the student will be granted a Bridging Visa A, allowing her to stay legally in Australia until a decision is made ([IStudentPlus](https://www.istudentplus.com/how-to-extend-your-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   **Application Refusal:** If the visa extension is refused, the student has options such as reapplying with additional supporting documents or appealing the decision through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) ([Lynx Global](https://lynxglobal.com.au/australia-student-visa-extension/)). Seeking assistance from immigration professionals can enhance the appeal.\n*   **Maintaining Compliance:** It is essential to maintain compliance with visa conditions, including full-time enrollment and maintaining OSHC ([Lynx Global](https://lynxglobal.com.au/australia-student-visa-extension/)).\n\n### The Importance of Seeking Support\n\nNavigating the visa extension process can be complex, and the student should be encouraged to seek support from various resources:\n\n*   **Educational Institution:** The university's international student support services can provide guidance on visa requirements and documentation ([Lynx Global](https://lynxglobal.com.au/australia-student-visa-extension/)).\n*   **Registered Migration Agent:** Consulting a registered migration agent can provide personalized advice and ensure that the application is complete and accurate ([Migration Agents Perth](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/how-to-change-course-for-international-students-in-australia/)).*   **IStudentPlus:** IStudentPlus offers personalized guidance, document review, and 24/7 support to ensure the visa extension application is successful ([IStudentPlus](https://www.istudentplus.com/how-to-extend-your-australian-student-visa/)).### Additional Considerations\n\n*   **Timeframe for Application:** It is recommended to apply at least 2-3 months before the current visa expires to allow enough time for processing ([LegalFinda](https://legalfinda.com.au/blog/extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-a-complete-guide-for-foreign-students)). Some sources suggest 3-6 months ([VisaFast](https://www.visafast.com.au/blog/student-visa-7/student-visa-extension-australia-23)).\n*   **Course Completion:** Students must complete their course within the expected duration specified on their CoE unless an extension is granted for compelling reasons ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Academic Progress:** Students need to pass at least 50% of enrolled units each semester and attend all mandatory assessment activities ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Post-Study Options:** After completing her studies, the student may have options to stay longer in Australia, such as applying for a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) or pursuing further studies ([True Blue Studies](https://truebluestudies.com.au/stay-in-australia-on-my-student-visa-after-course-completion/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nInforming the student about the need to apply for a student visa extension involves providing a clear and detailed explanation of the process, requirements, and potential challenges. By following the steps outlined above and seeking support from relevant resources, the student can navigate the visa extension process successfully and complete her Bachelor of Arts program in Australia. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of maintaining compliance with visa conditions and seeking professional advice when needed.\n\n### References\n\nDMS Migration. (2021, September 13).

      "full_response": "# A Comprehensive Report on Student Complaints in Australia\n\nThe landscape of student complaints in Australia's higher education sector has undergone a significant transformation with the establishment of the National Student Ombudsman (NSO). This report aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive overview of the current state of student complaints, focusing on the role of the NSO, the types of complaints handled, and the processes involved. Based on the provided information, the most accurate statement regarding student complaints in Australia is that the **National Student Ombudsman (NSO) now provides an independent and impartial avenue for higher education students to escalate complaints about their providers if they are dissatisfied with the provider's response** ([Department of Education, 2025a](https://www.education.gov.au/newsroom/articles/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints)). This report will delve into the nuances of this statement, providing context and supporting evidence from various sources.\n\n## The National Student Ombudsman (NSO): A New Era for Student Complaints\n\nThe establishment of the NSO on February 1, 2025, marks a pivotal moment in the handling of student grievances within the Australian higher education system ([Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025); [Department of Education, 2025b](https://www.education.gov.au/national-student-ombudsman/announcements/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints)). This initiative stems from the Australian Universities Accord Final Report and the Action Plan to address gender-based violence in higher education, highlighting the government's commitment to ensuring a fair and safe environment for all students ([NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n\n### Mandate and Scope\n\nThe NSO operates as an independent and impartial body with the authority to investigate student complaints and resolve disputes with higher education providers ([Department of Education, 2025b](https://www.education.gov.au/national-student-ombudsman/announcements/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints); [Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)). Its jurisdiction extends to all TEQSA-registered higher education providers, encompassing undergraduate, postgraduate, domestic, and international students ([Queensland Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/blog/a-new-national-complaint-service-for-higher-education-students); [Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman)). Notably, there is no time limit on historical complaints, allowing the NSO to address long-standing issues ([NSW Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombo.nsw.gov.au/about-us/news-events/news/national-student-ombudsman-to-commence-in-february); [Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)).\n\n### Complaint Resolution and Powers\n\nThe NSO's primary role is to assess the fairness and reasonableness of a higher education provider's actions in handling a complaint ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman)). While it does not make new decisions on complaints, the NSO can:\n\n*   Make written recommendations to the provider ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman); [ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Offer restorative engagement processes to facilitate dialogue between students and providers ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman); [ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Provide mediation or alternative dispute resolution options ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman); [ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n\nThe NSO possesses strong investigative powers, akin to those of a Royal Commission, including the ability to:\n\n*   Require universities to provide information and documents ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Enter university premises as part of an investigation ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Compel university officers or employees to answer questions ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n\n### Types of Complaints Handled\n\nThe NSO addresses a wide array of issues, including:\n\n*   Student safety and welfare, encompassing gender-based violence, discrimination, and racism ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman); [ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens); [NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n*   Course administration, such as the timeliness and accuracy of information provided to students ([Department of Education, 2025a](https://www.education.gov.au/newsroom/articles/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints); [NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n*   Teaching provisions and facilities, including staffing adequacy ([Department of Education, 2025a](https://www.education.gov.au/newsroom/articles/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints); [NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n*   Disciplinary processes ([Department of Education, 2025a](https://www.education.gov.au/newsroom/articles/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints); [NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n*   Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities or special circumstances ([Department of Education, 2025a](https://www.education.gov.au/newsroom/articles/national-student-ombudsman-now-taking-complaints); [NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)).\n*   Student enrolment, reasonable adjustments, and exclusion ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Student applications for special consideration ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Provider changes to course structures ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Provider's complaint and appeal procedures ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Provider's failure to clearly explain their decisions ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n\n### Complaints Outside the NSO's Jurisdiction\n\nThe NSO does not handle all types of student complaints. Specifically, it does not consider:\n\n*   Complaints related to VET courses (except when VET courses are provided by TAFEs and universities across Queensland) ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens); [Queensland Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/blog/a-new-national-complaint-service-for-higher-education-students)).\n*   Complaints concerning academic judgment, such as grades awarded ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Complaints related to an individual's employment with a higher education provider ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Complaints related to the appointment of a person to an office of a higher education provider ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n*   Complaints related to education providers who are not TEQSA registered ([ADCET, n.d.a](https://www.adcet.edu.au/resource/11915/independent-national-student-ombudsman-opens)).\n\n### Making a Complaint to the NSO\n\nStudents can lodge complaints with the NSO through various channels, ensuring accessibility and support ([Study Australia, n.d.a](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman)). The NSO also offers information and advice to students unsure about making a complaint ([NSO, n.d.a](https://www.nso.gov.au/about-us)). The contact details for the NSO are:\n\n*   Phone: 1300 395 775 ([Queensland Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/blog/a-new-national-complaint-service-for-higher-education-students); [Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)).*   Website: [nso.gov.au](https://www.nso.gov.au/) ([Queensland Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/blog/a-new-national-complaint-service-for-higher-education-students); [Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)).\n\n## The Role of State and Territory Ombudsmen\n\nWhile the NSO handles complaints related to higher education providers, State and Territory Ombudsmen continue to play a crucial role in addressing complaints related to VET courses with public providers ([Study Australia, n.d.b](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman); [Study Assist, 2025b](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)). For instance, the NSW Ombudsman will continue to handle complaints from TAFE students and staff ([NSW Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombo.nsw.gov.au/about-us/news-events/news/national-student-ombudsman-to-commence-in-february)). In Queensland, the Queensland Ombudsman will continue to manage complaints about TAFEs and universities across Queensland when they provide Vocational Education and Training (VET) ([Queensland Ombudsman, 2025](https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/blog/a-new-national-complaint-service-for-higher-education-students)).\n\n## International Student Complaints\n\nInternational students studying with private providers should continue to contact the Overseas Student Ombudsman for assistance ([Study Australia, n.d.b](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/the-new-national-student-ombudsman)). The Commonwealth Ombudsman can investigate complaints from international students about private schools, colleges, institutes, and universities in Australia ([Commonwealth Ombudsman, n.d.a](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/complaints/international-student-complaints)). Issues that the Commonwealth Ombudsman can address include course fees and refunds, transfers between courses or providers, and handling of complaints or appeals ([Commonwealth Ombudsman, n.d.a](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/complaints/international-student-complaints)).\n\n## University-Level Complaint Processes\n\nUniversities also have their own internal complaint processes. For example, at the University of Melbourne, students can raise complaints or grievances related to actions, decisions, or omissions within the University's control ([University of Melbourne, n.d.a](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-life/rights-and-responsibilities/student-complaints-and-grievances)). Students are encouraged to seek advice from a Student Advocate at the University of Melbourne Student Union (UMSU) before submitting a complaint ([University of Melbourne, n.d.a](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-life/rights-and-responsibilities/student-complaints-and-grievances)).\n\nVictoria University has a Student Complaints Procedure that outlines the process for managing student complaints, including informal resolution, formal complaint management, and decision-making ([Victoria University, n.d.a](https://policy.vu.edu.au/document/view.php?id=175)). The procedure aims to ensure that findings and recommendations are evidence-based and defensible ([Victoria University, n.d.a](https://policy.vu.edu.au/document/view.php?id=175)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe establishment of the National Student Ombudsman represents a significant step forward in ensuring fairness and accountability in the Australian higher education sector. By providing an independent avenue for students to escalate complaints, the NSO empowers students and promotes a more equitable and supportive learning environment. While the NSO has a broad mandate, it is essential to recognize the continued role of State and Territory Ombudsmen and the Overseas Student Ombudsman in addressing specific types of complaints. Students should also be aware of the internal complaint processes available at their respective universities. The NSO commenced operations on February 1, 2025, and is now available to receive escalated complaints from higher education students ([Study Assist, 2025a](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/news/national-student-ombudsman-commenced-1-february-2025)).\n\n## References\n\nADCET.

      "full_response": "## Proposed Course Changes Requiring a New Student Visa in Australia (2025)\n\nThe Australian government has implemented significant changes to its student visa (Subclass 500) program, effective January 1, 2025, to ensure visa integrity and attract genuine international students ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). Among these changes, regulations surrounding course alterations are critical for international students to understand. This report aims to elucidate which proposed course changes might necessitate a student obtaining a new visa, drawing upon recent updates and guidelines. Based on the information available, a course change that results in a student enrolling in a course at a lower level than their current visa, or one that extends the overall study duration without proper authorization, will likely require a new visa application.\n\n### Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) and Visa Validity\n\nA central element of the 2025 student visa changes is the mandatory requirement of a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for all student visa applications, whether lodged onshore or offshore ([visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). The Department of Home Affairs no longer accepts Letters of Offer as proof of admission ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). The CoE is an official document issued by the educational institution, confirming a student's enrollment in a registered course, including details such as the course of study, program duration, and tuition fees ([blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\nVisa validity is tied to the course length. For courses exceeding 10 months and ending in November or December, the visa is valid until March 15 of the following year. For courses ending earlier, the visa extends two months beyond the course's end date, and courses lasting 10 months or less grant visas valid for one month beyond the study period ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Course Changes Requiring a New Visa\n\nAccording to [Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/), students must notify the Department of Home Affairs within seven days if they change their course. A new visa is required if the new course is at the same level or higher than the current visa. Based on this information, the following scenarios are likely to require a new student visa:\n\n1.  **Changing to a Lower-Level Course:** If a student enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program decides to switch to a diploma or certificate program, this would be considered a change to a lower level of study. In such cases, the student's current visa, which was granted based on their enrollment in a higher education program, would no longer be valid ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n2.  **Unauthorized Extension of Study Duration:** If a student changes courses in a way that extends their overall study duration beyond the initial visa grant without proper authorization, they will likely need to apply for a new visa ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). This is because the initial visa was issued based on a specific course length, and any extension requires reassessment by the Department of Home Affairs.\n\n3.  **Changes Affecting Visa Conditions:** Certain course changes might impact the student's ability to meet the conditions of their existing visa. For instance, if a student's visa was granted based on their enrollment in a full-time course, and they switch to a part-time course, this could violate the visa conditions and necessitate a new application.\n\n### Maintaining Compliance with Visa Conditions\n\nInternational students must adhere to several conditions to maintain their visa status. These include:\n\n*   **Satisfactory Academic Progress:** Students need to achieve satisfactory academic results as defined by their educational institution. Failing to meet these standards can lead to reporting to the Department of Home Affairs, potentially affecting their visa status ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Students must pass at least 50% of enrolled units each semester and complete their course within the expected duration ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Course Attendance:** Students must attend all mandatory assessment activities and participate in intervention strategies if required ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Work Limitations:** Students are allowed to work up to 48 hours per fortnight during term time and unlimited hours during scheduled course breaks. Overworking can lead to visa cancellation ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Health Insurance:** Students must maintain valid Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the entire duration of their stay in Australia. Failure to do so can result in visa conditions not being met ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Address Notification:** Students must notify their education provider of their Australian address within seven days of arriving and update any change of address within seven days of moving ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Actionable Steps for Students\n\nTo navigate the complexities of student visa regulations and course changes, international students should take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Consult with Educational Institutions:** Students should consult with their educational institutions for timely guidance on visa policies and application steps ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n2.  **Start Early:** Students should begin the application process months in advance to secure their CoE in time ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n3.  **Monitor Visa Validity:** Students should keep track of their visa's expiration date and avoid letting their status lapse. Failing to manage this properly could result in removal from the country or other penalties ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n4.  **Inform Authorities of Course Changes:** Students must notify the Department of Home Affairs within seven days if they change their course ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Australian student visa landscape has undergone significant changes in 2025, with stricter guidelines for applicants. The mandatory CoE requirement and the potential need for a new visa due to course changes demand greater preparation and foresight from international students. A course change that results in a student enrolling in a course at a lower level than their current visa, or one that extends the overall study duration without proper authorization, will likely require a new visa application. By understanding these requirements and consulting with educational institutions, students can navigate the visa process more effectively and ensure a smooth and secure study experience in Australia.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n[acic.melbourne](https://acic.melbourne/en/updated-coe-requirement-for-onshore-student-visas-in-2025/)\n\n[avie.com.au](https://avie.com.au/student-visa-changes-2025/)\n\n[blog.admission.ac](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)\n\n[getgis.org](https://getgis.org/news/new-requirements-for-australia-student-visa-from-january-2025)\n\n[immigrationnewsaustralia.com](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)\n\n[insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)\n\n[kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)\n\n[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/australia-student-visa-changes-key-updates-2025-trenity-consultants-qudxf/)\n\n[studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/important-change-to-student-visa-applications-lodged-in-australi)\n\n[visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)\n\n[visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)"

      "full_response": "## The Principal Course of Study in Australian Student Visa Applications: A Detailed Report\n\nIn the context of Australian student visa applications, particularly the Subclass 500 visa, the term \"principal course of study\" holds significant weight. It dictates various aspects of the visa application process, including financial and English language skill requirements, and plays a crucial role in determining a student's ability to change courses or providers. This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principal course of study, drawing upon recent updates and regulations in the Australian student visa landscape, particularly those effective in 2025.\n\n### Defining the Principal Course of Study\n\nThe principal course of study is the main course that leads to the highest qualification the student intends to obtain while holding a student visa ([University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/policy/policy-definitions/definitions/principal-course-of-study)). This definition is particularly relevant for students undertaking packaged courses, where multiple courses are bundled together to achieve a higher qualification. In such cases, the final course in the package, leading to the highest qualification, is considered the principal course of study ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)).\n\nFor instance, if a student enrolls in a packaged course consisting of an English language course (ELICOS), followed by a diploma, and then a bachelor's degree, the bachelor's degree would be considered the principal course of study ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). This designation has implications for the student's visa conditions and their ability to change courses or providers within the first six months of their studies.\n\n### Implications for Visa Requirements\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs uses the principal course of study to determine the level of evidence required for finances and English language skills ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)). This means that the requirements for the principal course, rather than any preceding courses in a package, will dictate the necessary documentation.\n\nFor example, if the principal course is a master's degree, the student must demonstrate sufficient financial capacity to cover the tuition fees and living expenses associated with a master's degree program. Similarly, the English language proficiency requirements for the master's degree will need to be met, even if the student is initially undertaking an ELICOS course as part of the package ([Saga Studies](https://sagastudies.com/australian-student-visa-subclass-500-a-complete-guide/)).### Changing Courses and Providers\n\nThe principal course of study also plays a crucial role in determining a student's ability to change courses or education providers. According to Visa Envoy, if a student has completed six months or more of their principal course, they are generally free to change providers at any time, unless they have signed an agreement with their provider that prevents them from doing so ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)).\n\nHowever, if a student has not completed six months of their principal course and wishes to change providers, they must meet specific criteria, such as obtaining a letter of release from their current provider or demonstrating that they are unable to continue studying due to circumstances beyond their control ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). This restriction is in place to ensure that students are genuinely committed to their chosen course of study and are not using the student visa program for purposes other than education.\n\nFurthermore, changes to the Subclass 500 visa conditions, particularly those effective from July 1, 2022, have introduced stricter regulations regarding changing courses, especially for courses at a lower level ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). Students wishing to transfer to a course at a lower level than their current studies may need to apply for a new student visa, and there is a risk that the visa application could be refused unless legitimate reasons are provided for the change ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)).\n\n### The Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) and its Significance in 2025\n\nA significant update to the Australian student visa system, effective from January 1, 2025, is the mandatory requirement for a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for all student visa applications, including those lodged onshore ([Visa and Immigrations](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/),[Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). This replaces the previous acceptance of Letters of Offer for onshore applications. The CoE is a document issued by the educational institution confirming a student's place in a registered course and requires upfront tuition payments ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\nThis change aims to promote commitment to education, reduce administrative delays, and support education providers by increasing certainty in enrolments ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/student-visa-australia-major-updates-you-need-know-2025-banerjee-ldqpf)). The introduction of the CoE requirement also means that onshore applicants must ensure all documents are ready before lodging their visa application, as onshore applications could experience longer wait times if not filed properly ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/student-visa-australia-major-updates-you-need-know-2025-banerjee-ldqpf)).\n\n### Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the student visa application process is the Genuine Student (GS) requirement, which replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement on March 23, 2024 ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The GS requirement assesses the applicant's intention to study in Australia and involves answering targeted questions about their studies, plans, and circumstances ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\nApplicants must provide a statement of purpose (SoP) outlining their academic background, reasons for choosing Australia and their specific course, career goals, evidence of research about their institution and course, explanation of any gaps in their education history, and plans for returning to their home country after studies ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Immigration officials carefully assess this document for authenticity, so it is essential to be genuine and detailed in the SoP ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Visa Conditions and Compliance\n\nStudent visa holders must comply with several conditions to maintain their visa status. These include:*   Maintaining enrolment in a registered course ([Visa Home](https://visahome.com.au/student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n*   Meeting course requirements and maintaining satisfactory attendance and course progression ([Visa Home](https://visahome.com.au/student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n*   Staying within the visa limit on working hours while studying ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n*   Maintaining adequate health insurance for the whole of their stay in Australia ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n*   Not overstaying their visa period in Australia ([Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n\nFailure to comply with these conditions can result in visa cancellation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe principal course of study is a central concept in the Australian student visa application process. It determines the level of evidence required for finances and English language skills and influences a student's ability to change courses or providers. The introduction of the CoE requirement in 2025 further emphasizes the importance of commitment to education and streamlines the application process. Prospective students must understand these regulations and prepare accordingly to ensure a smooth visa application process and a successful study experience in Australia. Staying informed about the latest updates and seeking guidance from educational institutions or migration agents is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of Australian student visas.\n\n### References\n\nKangaroo Edu.

      "full_response": "## Standard 1 of the National Code 2018: An Analysis of Marketing and Information Requirements for Australian Education Providers\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) is a crucial legislative instrument in Australia's international education sector. It establishes nationally consistent standards that education providers must adhere to in order to maintain their registration and provide quality education and training to overseas students ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)). Standard 1 of the National Code 2018 specifically addresses marketing information and practices, aiming to uphold the integrity and reputation of Australia's education industry ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/resources/standard-1-marketing-information-and-practices)). This report will analyze the requirements of Standard 1 and identify a statement that would be considered false in light of these regulations.\n\n### Overview of the National Code 2018\n\nThe National Code 2018, which commenced on January 1, 2018, is a key component of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) framework ([Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/national-code-practice)). It is designed to protect the interests of overseas students, ensure the quality of education and training, and promote Australia as a leading destination for international education ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Pages/National-Code-2018-Factsheets-.aspx)). The code comprises eleven standards, each addressing a specific aspect of the education provider's responsibilities towards overseas students ([IMC](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/esos-national-code-information/)).\n\n### Standard 1: Marketing Information and Practices\n\nStandard 1 mandates that registered providers must ensure their marketing of education and training services is professional, accurate, and maintains the integrity and reputation of the industry ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/resources/standard-1-marketing-information-and-practices)). This standard aims to prevent unethical practices and protect both providers and students from misleading information ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n\nKey requirements under Standard 1 include:\n\n*   **Professional and Accurate Marketing:** Providers must market their services in a professional manner, reflecting their expertise and ensuring honesty and accuracy in all marketing materials ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). False or misleading information, such as inaccurate campus locations or false comparisons with other providers, is strictly prohibited ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n*   **Clear Identification:** Providers must clearly identify their registered name and CRICOS number in all written marketing materials, including electronic formats ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). This ensures transparency and allows students to verify the provider's registration status.\n*   **Prohibition of False or Misleading Information:** Providers are prohibited from providing false or misleading information or advice regarding claims of association between providers, employment outcomes associated with a course, automatic acceptance into another course, possible migration outcomes, or any other claims relating to the provider, its courses, or associated outcomes ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n*   **Restrictions on Recruitment:** Providers must not actively recruit students where it conflicts with their obligations under Standard 7, which governs transfers between registered providers ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n*   **Ethical Conduct of Education Agents:** Registered providers are responsible for ensuring that their education agents act ethically, honestly, and in the best interests of overseas students ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos/esos_national_code_information_for_students_and_staff)). They must have written agreements with their agents, maintain their details in PRISMS, and take corrective action if an agent engages in unethical practices ([IMC](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/esos-national-code-information/)).\n\n### Identifying a False Statement\n\nBased on the requirements of Standard 1, the following statement would be considered false:\n\n**\"A provider can promote and market a course for which it has applied, but is yet to receive, registration.\"**\n\nThis statement is false because the National Code explicitly prohibits providers from marketing courses that are not yet registered to be offered to overseas students ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). The example of the College of Hospitality illustrates this point: the college was in breach of the Code and the Act because it marketed a course to international students before it was registered to offer it to them ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). The college should have restricted its promotional activities to informing prospective students that it had applied for registration of the course, but not actively marketed it.\n\n### Consequences of Non-Compliance\n\nFailure to comply with Standard 1, or any other standard of the National Code 2018, can have serious consequences for registered providers. Breaches of the National Code can result in actions being taken against them ([IMC](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/esos-national-code-information/)). These actions may include:\n\n*   **Sanctions:** TEQSA, the ESOS agency for some institutions like IMC, can impose sanctions on providers that fail to meet the requirements of the National Code ([IMC](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/esos-national-code-information/)).\n*   **Suspension or Cancellation of Registration:** In severe cases, providers may have their registration suspended or cancelled, preventing them from enrolling overseas students ([Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/national-code-practice)).\n*   **Damage to Reputation:** Non-compliance can damage a provider's reputation, making it more difficult to attract overseas students in the future ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/resources/standard-1-marketing-information-and-practices)).\n\n### Best Practices for Compliance\n\nTo ensure compliance with Standard 1 and maintain the integrity of their marketing practices, education providers should adopt the following best practices:\n\n*   **Review Marketing Materials:** Regularly review all marketing materials, including websites, brochures, and advertisements, to ensure they are accurate, up-to-date, and not misleading ([International Education](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n*   **Verify Information:** Verify all information provided to prospective students, including course details, fees, and potential outcomes, to ensure its accuracy ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos/esos_national_code_information_for_students_and_staff)).\n*   **Train Staff and Agents:** Provide comprehensive training to staff and education agents on the requirements of the National Code and the importance of ethical marketing practices ([IMC](https://www.imc.edu.au/study/information-for-students/esos-national-code-information/)).\n*   **Monitor Education Agents:** Regularly monitor the activities of education agents to ensure they are complying with the National Code and acting in the best interests of overseas students ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos/esos_national_code_information_for_students_and_staff)).\n*   **Seek Legal Advice:** Seek independent legal advice to ensure full compliance with the National Code and the ESOS Act ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStandard 1 of the National Code 2018 plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and reputation of Australia's international education sector. By ensuring that marketing information and practices are accurate, professional, and ethical, the standard protects the interests of overseas students and promotes Australia as a trusted destination for quality education and training. The statement \"A provider can promote and market a course for which it has applied, but is yet to receive, registration\" is demonstrably false, as it directly contradicts the requirements of Standard 1. Education providers must prioritize compliance with this standard to avoid potential sanctions, protect their reputation, and contribute to the overall success of Australia's international education industry.\n\n### References\n\nDepartment of Education, Australian Government.

      "full_response": "## English Proficiency Exemptions for Australian Student Visas in 2025\n\nThe Australian government has implemented stricter student visa requirements effective January 1, 2025, to enhance the integrity of its international education system ([Visaliv, 2024, December 30](https://visaliv.com/news/australias-new-student-visa-rules-effective-january-2025)). These changes include increased financial requirements, enhanced English proficiency standards, and age restrictions for graduate visas ([Visaliv, 2024, December 30](https://visaliv.com/news/australias-new-student-visa-rules-effective-january-2025)). While most applicants are required to provide evidence of English language proficiency, certain categories of students assessed under regular evidentiary requirements may be exempt from submitting test scores. This report aims to identify which students, under regular evidentiary requirements, would *not* need to present an English proficiency test score to obtain a student visa, based on the provided information.\n\n### Overview of English Language Requirements\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs generally requires applicants for student visas to demonstrate a certain level of English language proficiency ([Department of Home Affairs](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/english-language)). Accepted tests include IELTS, TOEFL iBT, Cambridge English (CAE), and PTE Academic ([Department of Home Affairs](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/english-language)). However, the specific requirements and exemptions can be complex and depend on various factors, including the applicant's country of origin, education history, and intended course of study ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n### Exemptions from English Language Testing\n\nSeveral categories of students may be exempt from providing English language test scores, even under regular evidentiary requirements. These exemptions are generally based on factors that demonstrate a student's English proficiency through alternative means. Based on the provided sources, the following students would likely *not* need to present an English proficiency test score:\n\n1.  **Citizens and Passport Holders of Specific Countries:** Students who are citizens and passport holders of the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand, or the Republic of Ireland are typically exempt from providing English language test scores ([Australian Visa Lawyer](https://australianvisalawyer.com.au/english-requirements-for-australian-student-visas/); [Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)). This exemption is based on the assumption that citizens of these countries have a sufficient level of English proficiency due to their nationality ([Australian Visa Lawyer](https://australianvisalawyer.com.au/english-requirements-for-australian-student-visas/); [Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n2.  **Students with Significant Prior Study in English-Speaking Countries:** Applicants who have completed at least five years of study in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, the Republic of Ireland, the UK, or the USA may be exempt ([Australian Visa Lawyer](https://australianvisalawyer.com.au/english-requirements-for-australian-student-visas/); [Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)). This exemption acknowledges that students who have completed a significant portion of their education in these countries have already demonstrated their English proficiency ([Australian Visa Lawyer](https://australianvisalawyer.com.au/english-requirements-for-australian-student-visas/); [Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n3.  **Students Completing Senior Secondary Education in Australia:** Students who have successfully completed the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education or study at Certificate IV level or higher in Australia within two years of applying for a student visa may also be exempt ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)). This exemption recognizes that completing a senior secondary qualification in Australia demonstrates a student's ability to study in English ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n4.  **Students Enrolled in Specific Courses:** Students enrolled full-time in school studies as a principal course (including secondary exchange programs), postgraduate research, or a standalone ELICOS program may be exempt ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)). However, it is important to note that even if a student is enrolled in an ELICOS program, they may still need to demonstrate a certain level of English proficiency to gain entry into the program itself ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n5. **Sponsored Students:** Foreign Affairs or Defence sponsored students or a Secondary Exchange student (AASES) may be exempt ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/Blog/about-australia/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n### The Role of Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)\n\nThe introduction of the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) as a core requirement for student visa applications from January 1, 2025, is a significant change ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). The CoE replaces Letters of Offer and requires upfront tuition payments ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). For students assessed at the lowest immigration risk level, providing a CoE may be sufficient to meet the English language requirements, as it is recognized that the English language requirements for their course are equal to or greater than those required for a student visa ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/english-language-requirements-faqs)). However, students assessed at a higher immigration risk level will still need to provide evidence of English language proficiency through an approved test score ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/english-language-requirements-faqs)).\n\n### Minimum IELTS Score\n\nThe minimum IELTS score required for a student visa is now 6.0, and 6.5 for a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025, January 5](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). These scores reflect the increased English proficiency standards implemented in 2025 ([Admission Ac Blog, 2025, January 5](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\n### TOEFL iBT\n\nAs of 2025, the Australian government has temporarily suspended the acceptance of TOEFL scores for visa applications ([Kandor IELTS Prep & Study Abroad Blog](https://blog.trykandor.com/toefl-not-accepted-australia-visa-2025)). International students still have multiple valid options for proving their English language proficiency, including IELTS, PTE, and Duolingo ([Kandor IELTS Prep & Study Abroad Blog](https://blog.trykandor.com/toefl-not-accepted-australia-visa-2025)).\n\n### Importance of Early Preparation\n\nFor students planning to study in Australia in 2025, early preparation is crucial ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Students should begin the application process months in advance to secure their CoE in time ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). They should also budget accordingly, considering all upfront costs, including tuition fees required for the CoE and the application fee of AUD 1,600 ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, several categories of students assessed under regular evidentiary requirements may be exempt from providing English proficiency test scores for an Australian student visa in 2025. These include citizens and passport holders of specific English-speaking countries, students with significant prior study in English-speaking countries, students completing senior secondary education in Australia, students enrolled in specific courses, and sponsored students. However, it is essential for all applicants to carefully review the specific requirements and exemptions based on their individual circumstances and consult with educational institutions or migration agents for accurate guidance. The introduction of the CoE requirement and the increased English proficiency standards further emphasize the need for thorough preparation and understanding of the latest visa regulations.\n\n### References\n\nAdmission Ac Blog.

      "full_response": "## Determining the Purposes of the ESOS Act 2000: A Detailed Analysis\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 is a cornerstone of Australia's international education framework. It establishes the legal framework governing the delivery of education to overseas students studying in Australia on a student visa. Understanding the core purposes of the ESOS Act is crucial for ensuring the quality and integrity of the international education sector. Based on the provided information, this report will identify the three main purposes of the ESOS Act 2000 and determine which of the options is NOT one of those purposes.\n\n### Core Purposes of the ESOS Act 2000\n\nSeveral sources highlight the primary objectives of the ESOS Act 2000. Western Sydney University's governance resources state that the main purposes of the ESOS Act are to:\n\n1.  Protect the quality and reputation of Australian education ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos)).\n2.  Provide consumer protection for overseas students ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos)).\n3.  Protect the integrity of Australia's student visa system ([Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/about_uws/leadership/governance/education_services_for_overseas_students_esos)).\n\nThe Department of Education, which administers the ESOS Act, echoes these purposes, emphasizing that the Act:\n\n*   Protects and enhances Australia\u2019s reputation for quality education ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n*   Provides tuition protection ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n*   Supports the integrity of the student visa program ([Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n\nThe Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) also identifies similar objectives, noting that the ESOS Act aims to:\n\n*   Provide tuition assurance and refunds for overseas students ([ASQA](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n*   Protect and enhance Australia\u2019s reputation for quality education and training services ([ASQA](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n*   Complement Australia\u2019s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report relevant information relating to student visas ([ASQA](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n\nSkills Australia Institute reinforces these objectives, highlighting that the ESOS framework aims to provide a safe, enjoyable, and worthwhile study experience for international students, maintaining the quality of education, and protecting their consumer rights ([Skills Australia Institute](https://www.skillsaustralia.edu.au/international-students/esos-act-framework/)).\n\nTertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) also supports these purposes and states that the ESOS framework protects international students studying in Australia, protects and enhances Australia\u2019s reputation for quality education, and supports the integrity of Australia\u2019s student visa program ([TEQSA](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/cricos-and-elicos/what-esos-framework)).\n\n### Analyzing Potential Purposes\n\nBased on the consistent information from multiple reliable sources, the three main purposes of the ESOS Act 2000 are:\n\n1.  **Protecting the quality and reputation of Australian education.**\n2.  **Providing consumer protection (including tuition assurance) for overseas students.**\n3.  **Protecting the integrity of Australia's student visa system.**\n\nTherefore, any statement that deviates from these three core objectives would NOT be considered a primary purpose of the ESOS Act 2000.\n\n### Recent Amendments and Focus Areas\n\nRecent amendments to the ESOS Act, such as those discussed in the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024, further emphasize the ongoing commitment to these core purposes ([Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd2324a/24bd073a)). The Bill introduces new measures aimed at improving the quality, integrity, and sustainable growth of the international education sector. These measures include:\n\n*   Ministerial powers to pause the registration of new providers and new courses by registered providers ([Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd2324a/24bd073a)).\n*   Automatic cancellation of a provider\u2019s registration if they have not provided a course at a location to an overseas student in a period of 12 consecutive months ([Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd2324a/24bd073a)).\n*   Automatic suspension of a provider\u2019s registration when an ESOS agency or designated State authority determines that a provider does not meet the fit and proper test because it is under investigation for a specified offence ([Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd2324a/24bd073a)).\n\nThese amendments reflect a proactive approach to maintaining the quality and integrity of the international education sector, ensuring that the ESOS Act remains effective in achieving its core purposes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the ESOS Act 2000 primarily aims to protect the quality and reputation of Australian education, provide consumer protection for overseas students, and protect the integrity of Australia's student visa system. Any statement that does not align with these three objectives would not be considered a main purpose of the ESOS Act 2000. The ongoing amendments and reviews of the ESOS Act demonstrate the Australian government's commitment to upholding these core purposes and ensuring the continued success and integrity of the international education sector.***\n\n### References\n\nAustralian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA).

      "full_response": "## A Comprehensive Overview of the Australian Education System in 2025\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report aims to provide a detailed and accurate overview of the Australian education system in 2025, addressing key aspects and recent developments to assist counselors in providing informed guidance. The report will synthesize information from various sources, including government publications, news articles, and reports from educational organizations, to present a comprehensive picture of the current state and future direction of education in Australia.\n\n**Key Components of the Australian Education System**\n\nThe Australian education system is structured into three main tiers: primary, secondary, and tertiary education ([aecoverseas.com, 2025](https://www.aecoverseas.com/blog/education-system-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **Primary Education:** Typically starts at age five or six and covers the first six to seven years of schooling, focusing on foundational skills in literacy, numeracy, and social development ([aecoverseas.com, 2025](https://www.aecoverseas.com/blog/education-system-in-australia/)).\n*   **Secondary Education:** Begins at Year 7 or 8 and continues through Year 12, preparing students for higher education or the workforce with a mix of core subjects and electives ([aecoverseas.com, 2025](https://www.aecoverseas.com/blog/education-system-in-australia/)).\n*   **Tertiary Education:** Includes higher education (universities) and vocational training (VET), offering a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as practical, job-ready courses ([aecoverseas.com, 2025](https://www.aecoverseas.com/blog/education-system-in-australia/), [studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-studies/australias-education-system)).\n\n**Recent Developments and Reforms**\n\nSeveral significant reforms and initiatives are shaping the Australian education landscape in 2025.\n\n*   **Better and Fairer Schools Agreement (BFSA):** Commencing on January 1, 2025, the BFSA is a joint agreement between the Commonwealth, states, and territories aimed at creating a better and fairer education system for all students ([education.gov.au, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools/national-school-reform-agreement/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement-20252034), [federalfinancialrelations.gov.au](https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/agreements/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement)). It replaces the National School Reform Agreement (NSRA) and will run for 10 years, until December 31, 2034 ([education.gov.au, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools/national-school-reform-agreement/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement-20252034)). The BFSA ensures that all public schools in participating jurisdictions receive full and fair funding, putting them on a path to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) ([federalfinancialrelations.gov.au](https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/agreements/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement)).\n*   **National Priority Areas:** The BFSA focuses on three national priority areas: equity and excellence, wellbeing for learning and engagement, and a strong and sustainable workforce ([aph.gov.au, 2024](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_departments/Parliamentary_Library/Research/FlagPost/2024/August/Better_Fairer_Schools_Agreement)). These priorities are supported by 10 National Reform Directions aimed at improving student outcomes ([education.gov.au, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools/national-school-reform-agreement/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement-20252034)).\n*   **Australian Tertiary Education Commission (ATEC):** The government has committed to establishing the ATEC as an independent steward of Australia\u2019s tertiary education system ([education.gov.au, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/about-department/corporate-reporting/budget/budget-202425-overview)). The ATEC will drive growth, meet national skills needs through equity measures, and create a cohesive and diverse tertiary education system ([education.gov.au, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/about-department/corporate-reporting/budget/budget-202425-overview)). It is set to commence from July 1, 2025, and be fully operational by January 1, 2026, subject to the passage of legislation ([education.gov.au, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/australian-universities-accord/accord-202425-budget-and-myefo-measures/australian-tertiary-education-commission)).\n*   **Focus on Explicit Teaching:** There is a growing emphasis on explicit teaching methods in Australian schools. Explicit teaching involves clearly breaking down and explaining concepts to students, with the teacher in control ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)). This approach has been proven effective for teaching literacy and numeracy, especially for struggling students ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)).\n*   **International Education and Skills Strategic Framework:** The government is developing a new framework for a managed system to deliver sustainable growth and improve the quality and integrity of Australia\u2019s international education sector ([education.gov.au, 2024](https://www.education.gov.au/about-department/corporate-reporting/budget/budget-202425-overview)).\n\n**Challenges and Opportunities**\n\nDespite its strengths, the Australian education system faces several challenges.\n\n*   **Declining Educational Outcomes:** National and international testing has documented a consistent decline in Australian students' performance over the past two decades ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)). Recent NAPLAN tests show that one-third of students are not meeting minimum benchmarks in literacy and numeracy ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)).\n*   **Equity and Access:** Disparities in educational equity and access persist, particularly for students from disadvantaged communities ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)). Addressing socio-economic barriers and bridging the digital divide are essential to ensuring equal opportunities for all students ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n*   **Adapting to Technological Advancements:** The rapid pace of technological change presents both opportunities and challenges. Educators must stay abreast of emerging technologies and equip students with the digital skills necessary for success in the digital age ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n*   **Skills Alignment with Industry:** There is a growing demand for providers to better align their curriculum and student support with fast-evolving industry requirements ([hedx.com.au](https://hedx.com.au/how-will-tertiary-education-change-in-2025/)). Partnerships with industry and adapting curriculum more rapidly are crucial to meeting future skills needs ([hedx.com.au](https://hedx.com.au/how-will-tertiary-education-change-in-2025/)).\n\nHowever, there are also significant opportunities for improvement and innovation.\n\n*   **Personalized Learning:** Australian educators are increasingly embracing personalized learning, tailoring education experiences to meet individual student needs and abilities ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n*   **Digital Integration:** The integration of digital technologies is revolutionizing classrooms, enhancing engagement, collaboration, and critical thinking skills ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n*   **STEM Education:** A strong emphasis on STEM education is preparing students for the jobs of the future, empowering them to excel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n*   **Flexible Learning Environments:** Flexible learning spaces are gaining traction, accommodating diverse learning styles and preferences and promoting creativity and adaptability ([lifeandaustralia.com](https://lifeandaustralia.com/education/education-in-australia-innovations-trends-and-global-challenges/)).\n\n**Government Funding and Expenditure**\n\nGovernment funding plays a crucial role in supporting the Australian education system.\n\n*   **Recurrent Funding:** In 2025, recurrent funding for schools is estimated to total $31.1 billion, including $12.0 billion for government schools, $10.4 billion for Catholic schools, and $8.7 billion for independent schools ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools)).\n*   **Funding Sources:** State and territory governments provide most of the public recurrent funding for government schools, while the Australian Government provides most of the public recurrent funding for non-government schools ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools)).\n*   **Expenditure per Student:** Nationally in 2022-23, government recurrent expenditure per FTE student in all schools was $21,169 ([pc.gov.au](https://www.pc.gov.au/ongoing/report-on-government-services/2025/child-care-education-and-training/school-education)).\n\n**The Success of LBOTE Students**\n\nOne notable trend in Australian education is the success of students from language backgrounds other than English (LBOTE).\n\n*   **Outperformance:** LBOTE students consistently outperform their non-immigrant peers in various metrics ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)). By year 9, these students are 1.5 years ahead in numeracy and also outperform students from English-speaking backgrounds in writing, spelling, and grammar ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)).\n*   **Valuing Education:** This success is often attributed to the strong value placed on education by LBOTE families ([abc.net.au, 2025](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-29/new-school-year-in-2025-brings-hope-for-australian-students/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Australian education system in 2025 is undergoing significant reforms and facing both challenges and opportunities. The BFSA, ATEC, and increased focus on explicit teaching methods are key developments aimed at improving student outcomes and creating a fairer education system. While challenges such as declining educational outcomes and equity gaps persist, innovations in personalized learning, digital integration, and STEM education offer promising avenues for progress. The success of LBOTE students highlights the importance of valuing education and provides valuable lessons for the broader community.\n\n**Advice for Counselors**\n\nBased on the information presented, here is the advice for counselors undergoing training about the Australian education system:\n\n**True Statement:**\n\n*   The Better and Fairer Schools Agreement (BFSA) commenced on January 1, 2025, replacing the National School Reform Agreement (NSRA) and aims to ensure all public schools in participating jurisdictions receive full and fair funding, putting them on a path to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS).\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the key objectives and timeline of the BFSA, as supported by multiple sources ([education.gov.au, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/recurrent-funding-schools/national-school-reform-agreement/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement-20252034), [federalfinancialrelations.gov.au](https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/agreements/better-and-fairer-schools-agreement)). It highlights the agreement's focus on equitable funding and its commitment to achieving the SRS for all public schools.\n\n**Reference List**\n\n*   aecoverseas.com. (2025, January 14).

These criteria generally include:\n\n*   **Failing Grades:** Failing a certain number of courses or subjects within a specified period is a primary indicator of unsatisfactory performance ([ANU Policy Library](https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_002611)).\n*   **Low GPA:** Maintaining a Grade Point Average (GPA) below a certain threshold can also signify unsatisfactory progress ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n*   **Failure to Meet Course Requirements:** Not meeting specific requirements for a course, such as professional placements, can lead to a review of academic progression ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/academic-progression-policy)).\n*   **Exceeding Maximum Time to Complete:** Failing to complete a course within the maximum allowed time also constitutes unsatisfactory progress ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/academic-progression-policy)).\n*   **Withdrawal from Subjects:** Repeatedly withdrawing from subjects, especially after the census date, can also be a sign of unsatisfactory progress ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n\n### Specific Examples from Universities\n\nTo illustrate these criteria, let's examine specific examples from various universities:\n\n#### Australian National University (ANU)\n\nANU places students on academic probation if they:\n\n*   Fail four or more courses in their undergraduate program.\n*   Fail three or more courses in their postgraduate program.\n*   Fail a coursework course in any award program for a second time ([ANU Policy Library](https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_002611)).\n\nStudents fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress if:\n\n*   They fail eight or more courses in their undergraduate program.\n*   They fail five or more courses in their postgraduate program.\n*   They fail a coursework course in any award program for a third time ([ANU Policy Library](https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_002611)).\n\n#### James Cook University (JCU)\n\nJCU defines satisfactory academic performance as:\n\n*   Passing all core subjects.\n*   Maintaining a course GPA of 4.00 or above.\n*   Passing more than 50% of completed credit points ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n\nJCU also uses academic statuses to classify student performance:\n\n*   **Academic Caution:** Assigned to students who need to improve their performance, such as those failing a core subject for the first time or having a GPA between 3.00 and 4.00 ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n*   **Conditional:** Assigned to students with more significant performance issues, such as failing a subject listed in specific lists (List 2 or 3) or having a very low GPA ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n\n#### University of Melbourne\n\nThe University of Melbourne considers a student \"at risk\" of making unsatisfactory progress if the student:\n\n*   Fails 50% or more of the student\u2019s enrolled credit points for any one progress review period.\n*   Fails a compulsory or core subject for the first time.\n*   Withdraws from all subjects for any one progress review period ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n\nA student\u2019s progress is deemed unsatisfactory if the student:\n\n*   Reaches the maximum time to complete a course without completing the requirements of that course.\n*   Fails to meet a condition which has been imposed as part of an earlier academic progress review process.\n*   Withdraws after the census date from all enrolled subjects in the progress review period for the second time ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n\n### Processes and Support Mechanisms\n\nUniversities have processes to monitor academic progress and provide support to students at risk. These include:\n\n*   **Monitoring:** Regular reviews of student academic progress, often at the end of each teaching period ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n*   **Communication:** Notifying students of their academic status and any concerns about their progress ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n*   **Support:** Offering academic support, advice, and intervention strategies to help students improve their performance ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n*   **Intervention Plans:** Developing specific plans for international students to ensure they meet academic requirements ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n\n### Consequences of Unsatisfactory Academic Performance\n\nIf a student's academic performance does not improve, universities may take further action, including:\n\n*   **Conditions:** Placing conditions on enrolment, requiring students to meet specific performance targets ([JCU Australia](https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/academic-governance/student-experience/unsatisfactory-academic-performance-procedure)).\n*   **Suspension:** Temporarily preventing a student from enrolling in further courses ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)).\n*   **Exclusion:** Permanently excluding a student from the course ([RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/feedback-complaints-appeals/appeals)).\n\n### Appeals Process\n\nStudents who face suspension or exclusion typically have the right to appeal the decision. The appeals process generally involves:\n\n*   **Internal Appeal:** Lodging an appeal with the university, often to a higher authority such as the Deputy Vice-Chancellor ([ANU Australia](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/appeal-an-academic-progress-committee-exclusion)).\n*   **External Appeal:** If the internal appeal is unsuccessful, students may have the option to appeal to an external agency, such as the Commonwealth Ombudsman ([ANU Australia](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/appeal-an-academic-progress-committee-exclusion)).\n\n### Impact on International Students\n\nFor international students, unsatisfactory academic performance can have significant consequences for their student visa. Universities are required to report students who are not meeting satisfactory course progress to the relevant government department ([University of Melbourne](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1291/)). This can lead to visa cancellation and the student being required to leave Australia.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnsatisfactory academic performance in Australian universities is defined by a range of factors, including failing grades, low GPAs, failure to meet course requirements, and exceeding time limits. Universities have established policies and procedures to monitor student progress, provide support, and manage cases of unsatisfactory performance. These processes aim to ensure students meet academic standards and can successfully complete their courses. For international students, maintaining satisfactory academic progress is particularly crucial due to visa requirements. Students who are struggling academically should seek support from their university to improve their performance and avoid the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n*   ANU Policy Library.

      "full_response": "## Australia Student Visa Updates for 2025: A Comprehensive Report\n\nThe landscape of international education is constantly evolving, with countries adjusting their student visa policies to balance economic needs, maintain system integrity, and ensure genuine educational pursuits. Australia, a popular destination for international students, has implemented significant updates to its student visa regulations, effective January 1, 2025. These changes aim to streamline the visa process, prioritize genuine applicants, and align post-study opportunities with the country's workforce demands. This report will delve into the key aspects of these updates, providing a comprehensive overview for prospective students and stakeholders in the international education sector.\n\n### Key Changes to Australian Student Visa Regulations in 2025Based on the provided information, the following statements about Australian student visas are true:\n\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is mandatory for all student visa applications:** As of January 1, 2025, a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is a mandatory requirement for all Australian student visa applications, whether lodged onshore or offshore ([visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). This replaces the previous acceptance of Letters of Offer for onshore applications ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **The Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement:** The GTE, which assessed an applicant's intention to temporarily stay in Australia for study purposes, has been replaced by the GS requirement, effective March 23, 2024 ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). The GS involves answering targeted questions about the applicant's study plans, circumstances, and intentions ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Financial requirements for student visa applicants have increased:** The Australian government has increased the minimum savings required for student visa applicants to AU$24,505 in October 2023, marking a 17% increase from the previous AU$21,041. This was further adjusted in May 2024, increasing the requirement to AU$29,710, aligning with 75% of the national minimum wage ([financialexpress.com](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/investing-abroad-student-visa-rules-in-2025-what-international-students-need-to-know-in-2025-3763178/)).\n*   **Visa hopping is being restricted:** The Australian government is taking measures to limit \"visa hopping,\" where individuals exploit loopholes to extend their stay in Australia, sometimes indefinitely ([insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)).\n*   **The student visa fee has increased:** As of July 1, 2024, the subclass 500 student visa fee rose from $710 to $1,600, more than doubling the cost ([insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Implications of the New Regulations\n\nThe updated student visa rules have several implications for international students planning to study in Australia:\n\n*   **Increased financial burden:** The mandatory CoE requires upfront tuition payments, adding to the already substantial costs of visa application fees (AUD 1,600) and living expenses ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Students need to budget accordingly and demonstrate sufficient financial resources to cover these costs.\n*   **Stricter assessment of genuine intent:** The shift from GTE to GS signifies a more rigorous assessment of an applicant's genuine intention to study in Australia ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Applicants must provide clear and compelling evidence of their academic goals and future prospects.\n*   **Limited onshore application options:** Onshore applications without a CoE are invalid, potentially leading to a loss of lawful status if current visas expire before meeting the requirements ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Potential impact on post-study work opportunities:** The introduction of the Core Skills Occupation List in 2025 may influence post-study plans, as it identifies priority sectors for Australian employers ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Students may need to align their studies with these in-demand fields to improve their chances of transitioning to work visas after graduation.\n*   **Increased scrutiny of English language proficiency:** Higher scores may be required for some English language tests, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating adequate English skills for academic success ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Actionable Steps for Prospective Students\n\nTo navigate the updated student visa process successfully, prospective students should take the following steps:\n\n*   **Start early:** Begin the application process well in advance to secure a CoE in time ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Obtaining a CoE is a crucial first step, requiring early preparation and engagement with educational institutions.\n*   **Budget accordingly:** Account for all upfront costs, including tuition fees required for the CoE and the visa application fee ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Demonstrating proof of sufficient financial resources remains essential for visa approval.\n*   **Choose institutions wisely:** Select institutions that can issue CoEs promptly once enrollment requirements are met ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Prepare a strong GS statement:** Clearly articulate your academic goals, reasons for choosing Australia, and future career aspirations ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Provide evidence to support your claims and demonstrate a genuine intention to study temporarily in Australia.\n*   **Consult with education advisors:** Seek guidance from educational institutions and migration agents to stay informed about the latest visa policies and application procedures ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### Addressing Common Reasons for Visa Rejection\n\nUnderstanding the common reasons for student visa rejection can significantly improve an applicant's chances of success. Some frequent causes for refusal include:\n\n*   **Insufficient funds:** Failing to demonstrate adequate financial resources to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other associated costs ([getgis.org](https://getgis.org/blog/35-most-important-interview-questions-and-answers-for-australian-student-visa)).\n*   **Incomplete or incorrect documentation:** Providing incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent documents ([terratern.com](https://terratern.com/blog/australia-refusal-letter/)).\n*   **Weak GTE/GS statement:** Failing to convince the visa officer of a genuine intention to study temporarily in Australia and return home upon completion of studies ([terratern.com](https://terratern.com/blog/australia-refusal-letter/)).\n*   **Unsatisfactory academic achievements:** Not meeting the required academic qualifications for the chosen course ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons)).\n*   **Failure to meet health and character requirements:** Failing to meet the health and character requirements set by the Australian government ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons/)).\n\nTo avoid these pitfalls, applicants should:\n\n*   **Double-check all documents:** Ensure that all required documents are complete, accurate, and up-to-date ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons/)).\n*   **Provide clear and truthful information:** Be honest and transparent in all aspects of the application ([idp.com](https://www.idp.com/australia/study-to-migrate/genuine-temporary-entrant/)).\n*   **Address any potential concerns:** Proactively address any potential concerns or weaknesses in the application, such as gaps in education or previous visa refusals ([upgrad.com](https://www.upgrad.com/study-abroad/articles/interview-questions-for-australia-student-visa-/)).\n*   **Seek professional assistance:** Consult with a migration agent or education advisor to ensure that the application is complete and meets all requirements ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons/)).\n\n### The Genuine Student (GS) Requirement: A Closer Look\n\nThe GS requirement is a critical component of the Australian student visa assessment process. It aims to ensure that applicants are genuinely committed to their studies and are not using the student visa as a pathway to permanent residency ([idp.com](https://www.idp.com/australia/study-to-migrate/genuine-temporary-entrant/)).\n\nThe GS assessment considers various factors, including:\n\n*   **The applicant's circumstances in their home country:** This includes their financial situation, employment history, and family ties ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/a-guide-to-gte-in-australia)).\n*   **The reasons for wanting to study in Australia:** Applicants must articulate clear and compelling reasons for choosing Australia as their study destination ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons)).\n*   **The value and relevance of the enrolled course for future prospects:** The chosen course should align with the applicant's academic background and career aspirations ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/australian-student-visa-rejection-reasons)).\n*   **The applicant's immigration history:** Any previous visa applications, refusals, or cancellations will be taken into account ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/a-guide-to-gte-in-australia)).\n\nTo demonstrate genuine intent, applicants should:\n\n*   **Provide a detailed personal statement:** This statement should clearly articulate their academic goals, reasons for choosing Australia, and future career aspirations ([idp.com](https://www.idp.com/australia/study-to-migrate/genuine-temporary-entrant/)).\n*   **Provide supporting evidence:** Back up their claims with relevant documents, such as academic transcripts, employment records, and financial statements ([idp.com](https://www.idp.com/australia/study-to-migrate/genuine-temporary-entrant/)).\n*   **Be prepared for an interview:** Some applicants may be required to attend an interview to further assess their genuine intent ([amberstudent.com](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/a-guide-to-gte-in-australia)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Australian student visa landscape has undergone significant changes in 2025, with stricter requirements and a greater emphasis on genuine applicants. The mandatory CoE, increased financial burdens, and the shift to the GS requirement demand careful planning and preparation from prospective students. By understanding these changes and taking proactive steps to address potential concerns, international students can navigate the visa process successfully and pursue their academic aspirations in Australia. Staying informed, seeking professional guidance, and presenting a strong and genuine application are key to achieving a positive outcome.### References\n\nAmber Student. (2025, January 29).

      "full_response": "# Privacy and Disclosure of Student Information in Australian ELICOS Programs: A Detailed Report\n\nAs an education agent in Australia, navigating the complexities of student privacy and parental rights is crucial. The scenario presented involves a 17-year-old student enrolled in an English program, with the parents requesting access to the student's results. This report will analyze the legal and ethical considerations surrounding the disclosure of this information, focusing on the obligations of the English College. Based on the information available, the English College is likely to refuse to provide the parents with the student's results directly without the student's consent, considering the student's age and potential maturity.\n\n## Legal Framework: Privacy and Education in Australia\n\nSeveral key pieces of legislation and guidelines govern the handling of student information in Australia, particularly within the education sector. These include the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988, the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018), and various state and territory laws relating to health records and privacy.\n\n### Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 regulates the storage, collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by Australian Government agencies and private sector organizations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, which includes most non-government schools and English language colleges ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). The Act is based on the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), which outline how personal information should be handled.\n\n### National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018\n\nThe National Code 2018 sets standards for registered providers of education and training to overseas students. Standard 4 of the National Code emphasizes the ethical conduct of education agents and the responsibilities of CRICOS providers in monitoring their agents' activities ([ASQA](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/education-agents)). While the National Code focuses on the relationship between providers and agents, it indirectly touches on the need for transparency and ethical behavior in handling student information.\n\n### State and Territory Legislation\n\nSeveral states and territories have their own legislation regarding the privacy of personal information, particularly health information. For instance, the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW) and the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic) provide guidance on when a child or young person can make decisions about their personal information without parental consent ([ALRC](https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/for-your-information-australian-privacy-law-and-practice-alrc-report-108/68-decision-making-by-and-for-individuals-under-the-age-of-18/existing-australian-laws-relating-to-privacy-of-individuals-under-the-age-of-18/)).\n\n## The Rights of Students vs. the Rights of Parents\n\nA central issue in this scenario is the conflict between a student's right to privacy and a parent's right to information about their child's education. The Privacy Act does not explicitly differentiate between adults and children, leading to a complex situation where mature students can request that their information remain private ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)).\n\n### Maturity and Consent\n\nA student's capacity to give or withhold consent depends on their understanding and maturity. If a student demonstrates sufficient maturity to understand the implications of disclosing sensitive information, their wishes should be respected, even if they conflict with their parents' desires ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). Generally, 15 years is often considered the age at which a child is presumed to have the capacity to make decisions, but this is not a strict rule and depends on individual assessment ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)).### Parental Consent\n\nParents or guardians can give consent on behalf of a student if the child is very young or lacks the understanding to do so themselves ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). However, as a child matures, their right to privacy increases, and parental consent may no longer override the child's wishes, especially concerning sensitive information.\n\n### Health Records and Confidentiality\n\nIn the context of health records, minors generally have the legal capacity to make their own decisions, independently of their parents, in various situations ([You Legal](https://youlegal.com.au/you-legal-blogs/health-records-privacy-confidentiality-children-australia)). While this scenario concerns academic results rather than health records, the principle of respecting a mature minor's autonomy is relevant. From around 14 years of age, teenagers have the right to consent to simple health care treatment, and from 16 years, they have the same right to consent as adults.\n\n## The English College's Obligations\n\nGiven the legal framework and the specific circumstances, the English College has several obligations to consider:\n\n### Compliance with the Privacy Act\n\nThe college must comply with the APPs, ensuring that personal information is used only for the purpose for which it was collected, primarily education and wellbeing ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). Disclosure to parents must be on that basis.\n\n### Assessing the Student's Maturity\n\nThe college should assess the 17-year-old student's maturity and understanding of the situation. If the student demonstrates a reasonable expectation that their results should remain private, the college should respect this request ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)).\n\n### Balancing Parental Expectations\n\nWhile parents may have a contractual relationship with the school, the school also has a unique relationship and responsibility with its students ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). A parent's consent to receive information will not always be taken as the student\u2019s consent to disclose that information.\n\n### Transparency and Communication\n\nThe college's privacy policy should clearly state how information will or will not be disclosed, and the child's rights in the matter ([Cole School Experts](https://coleschoolexperts.com.au/2022/02/14/privacy-at-schools/)). The college should communicate this policy to both students and parents.\n\n## Recommendation and Conclusion\n\nIn this scenario, the English College should prioritize the privacy of the 17-year-old student. The college should:\n\n1.  **Communicate with the Student:** Discuss the parents' request with the student and explain their right to privacy.2.  **Assess Maturity:** Evaluate the student's maturity and understanding of the implications of disclosing their results.\n3.  **Obtain Consent:** If the student consents to the disclosure, the college can provide the results to the parents. If the student withholds consent, the college should respect this decision.\n4.  **Inform the Parents:** If the student does not consent, inform the parents that due to privacy regulations, the college cannot disclose the results without the student's permission. Explain the student's right to privacy and the college's obligation to respect that right.\n\nTherefore, the English College is likely to refuse to provide the parents with the student's results directly without the student's consent, considering the student's age and potential maturity. This approach aligns with Australian privacy laws and ethical guidelines, ensuring the protection of student privacy while acknowledging parental interest in their child's education. As an education agent, it is essential to understand these principles and advise parents accordingly, fostering a transparent and ethical relationship between all parties involved.\n\n## References\n\n*   Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA).

      "full_response": "## CRICOS in Australia: A Comprehensive Overview\n\nThe Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) is a critical component of Australia's international education framework. It serves as the official register of Australian education providers and their courses approved to offer education to international students on student visas ([cricos.education.gov.au](https://cricos.education.gov.au/)). This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CRICOS, its significance, requirements, and implications for both educational institutions and international students.\n\n### What is CRICOS?\n\nCRICOS is more than just a list; it's a quality assurance mechanism. It ensures that institutions and courses listed on the register meet specific standards set by the Australian government ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)). These standards cover various aspects, including course quality, student support services, and institutional operations ([360rto.com.au](https://360rto.com.au/cricos-requirements-guide-for-australian-rtos/)).\n\nThe CRICOS system is underpinned by the *Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000* and the *National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018* ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/registration-cricos)). The ESOS Act provides the legal framework for protecting the rights of international students and ensuring the quality of education providers. The National Code sets out the standards that CRICOS providers must adhere to, covering areas such as marketing, recruitment, student support, and complaints handling ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n\n### Significance of CRICOS for International Students\n\nFor international students, CRICOS registration is paramount for several reasons:\n\n*   **Visa Eligibility:** A Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from a CRICOS-registered course is a fundamental requirement for obtaining a student visa (subclass 500) ([makingeducation.edu.au](https://makingeducation.edu.au/student-visa-cricos-requirements/)). Without it, a student visa application cannot proceed.\n*   **Quality Assurance:** CRICOS registration guarantees that the course and the institution providing it meet rigorous quality standards set by the Australian government ([makingeducation.edu.au](https://makingeducation.edu.au/student-visa-cricos-requirements/)). This ensures that students receive a high-quality education that is recognized internationally.\n*   **Student Support Services:** Institutions registered on CRICOS are obligated to provide specific support services to international students, including academic support, welfare services, and assistance with accommodation and other practical matters ([makingeducation.edu.au](https://makingeducation.edu.au/student-visa-cricos-requirements/)).\n*   **Tuition Protection:** The ESOS framework includes provisions for tuition protection to ensure that students can complete their courses or receive refunds if their education provider is unable to deliver the course ([360rto.com.au](https://360rto.com.au/cricos-requirements-guide-for-australian-rtos/)). The Tuition Protection Service (TPS) helps students find an alternative course if their provider closes.\n\n### CRICOS Registration Requirements for Providers\n\nTo become a CRICOS-registered provider, an organization must undergo a rigorous application process ([360rto.com.au](https://360rto.com.au/cricos-requirements-guide-for-australian-rtos/)). This includes demonstrating compliance with the ESOS Act and the National Code, as well as meeting specific requirements set by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) for higher education providers and the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) for vocational education and training (VET) providers ([frontoadvisory.com.au](https://frontoadvisory.com.au/cricos-registration-requirements-explained/)).\n\nKey requirements for CRICOS registration include:\n\n*   **Compliance with the ESOS Framework:** Providers must demonstrate a thorough understanding of and commitment to complying with the ESOS Act, the National Code, and other relevant legislative instruments ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n*   **Financial Viability:** Providers must demonstrate that they have the financial resources to deliver the courses they offer to international students and to meet their obligations under the ESOS Act ([frontoadvisory.com.au](https://frontoadvisory.com.au/cricos-registration-requirements-explained/)).\n*   **Suitability of Staff:** Providers must ensure that their staff are qualified and experienced to deliver the courses they offer and to provide support services to international students ([frontoadvisory.com.au](https://frontoadvisory.com.au/cricos-registration-requirements-explained/)).\n*   **Adequacy of Facilities and Resources:** Providers must have adequate facilities and resources to deliver the courses they offer, including classrooms, libraries, and equipment ([policies.une.edu.au](https://policies.une.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=546)).\n*   **Quality Assurance Systems:** Providers must have robust quality assurance systems in place to ensure that their courses meet the required standards and that international students receive a high-quality education ([policies.une.edu.au](https://policies.une.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=546)).\n\n### Ongoing Obligations of CRICOS Providers\n\nOnce registered, CRICOS providers are subject to ongoing obligations to maintain their registration. These obligations include:\n\n*   **Compliance with the National Code:** Providers must continuously comply with the standards set out in the National Code ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n*   **Reporting Requirements:** Providers must report certain information about international students to the Provider Registration and International Students Management System (PRISMS) ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)). This includes information about student enrolments, course changes, and visa status.\n*   **Tuition Assurance:** Providers must participate in the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) and meet their obligations under the ESOS Act to protect international students' tuition fees ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/provider-checklists-key-dates-and-obligations)).\n*   **Annual Registration Charge:** Providers must pay an annual registration charge to the Department of Education ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/provider-checklists-key-dates-and-obligations)).\n*   **External Audits:** Higher education providers are required to undertake an independent external audit of their compliance with the ESOS Act and National Code every three years ([teqsa.gov.au](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/guides-resourses/resources/application-guides/guide-cricos-providers-undertaking-independent-external-audit)).\n\n### Finding CRICOS Information\n\nFinding CRICOS information is relatively straightforward. Here are several methods:\n\n*   **Official CRICOS Website:** The official Australian Government CRICOS website ([cricos.education.gov.au](https://cricos.education.gov.au/)) allows users to search for courses and institutions.\n*   **Institution Websites:** Educational institutions often display their CRICOS provider code on their website, typically in the footer ([internationalstudentaustralia.com.au](https://www.internationalstudentaustralia.com.au/study/courses/cricos)).\n*   **Promotional Materials:** CRICOS codes may also be found in brochures or other promotional materials from the institution ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)).\n*   **Contacting the Institution:** If the CRICOS code is not readily available, contacting the institution directly is a reliable way to obtain the necessary details ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)).\n\n### Recent Developments and Deadlines\n\nSeveral recent developments and deadlines are relevant to CRICOS providers:\n\n*   **Applications for Approval of School Providers (CRICOS):** In NSW, applications from school providers delivering courses to overseas students are due by March 31, 2025, for schools seeking renewal of approval or initial approval to begin delivery of courses in 2026 ([nsw.gov.au](https://www.nsw.gov.au/education-and-training/nesa/news/all/cricos-applications-due-31-march-2025)).\n*   **CRICOS Annual Registration Charge (CARC):** Providers are required to pay their CARC to the Department of Education by mid-March 2025 ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/provider-checklists-key-dates-and-obligations)).\n*   **Annual Registration Charge (ELICOS-only):** ASQA Annual Registration Charge (ELICOS-only providers) is payable ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/provider-checklists-key-dates-and-obligations)).\n*   **ESOS Annual Obligations:** Providers need to meet other obligations and deadlines to comply with the requirements of ongoing registration in 2025 ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/provider-checklists-key-dates-and-obligations)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCRICOS plays a vital role in ensuring the quality and integrity of Australia's international education sector. By setting standards for education providers and protecting the rights of international students, CRICOS helps to maintain Australia's reputation as a leading destination for international education. For educational institutions, CRICOS registration is essential for enrolling international students and accessing the benefits of the international education market. For international students, CRICOS registration provides assurance that their chosen course and institution meet the required standards and that they will receive the support they need to succeed in their studies. Staying informed about CRICOS requirements and obligations is crucial for both providers and students to ensure a positive and successful international education experience in Australia.\n\n### References\n\nASQA.
