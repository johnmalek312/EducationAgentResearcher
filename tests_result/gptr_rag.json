      "full_response": "## Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) Creation: A Detailed Report on PRISMS\n\n### Introduction\nThe international education sector in Australia is heavily regulated to ensure quality and protect the interests of overseas students. A critical component of this regulatory framework is the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), a document that serves as a cornerstone for international students seeking to study in Australia on a student visa. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system through which CoEs are created, focusing on the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS). By examining the role of PRISMS, this report will clarify the process of CoE creation and its significance within the broader context of Australian international education.\n\n### The Role of PRISMS in CoE Creation\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer to the query \"COEs (confirmation of enrolments) are created through:\" is **PRISMS**. PRISMS is the central system used by Australian education providers to manage and monitor international student data, including the creation, updating, and cancellation of CoEs ([Meshed Group, 2024](https://meshedgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HigherEdResources/pages/2489057891/PRISMS+Provider+Registration+and+International+Student+Management+System)).\n\nPRISMS, which stands for Provider Registration and International Student Management System, is a web-based database used to produce and track Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) documents for international students studying in Australia on a student visa ([ICEF, n.d.a](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/)). These CoEs are essential for the issuing of student visas. The system also contains the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS), which records all registered courses for each provider registered to provide education to overseas students studying in Australia on a student visa ([ICEF, n.d.a](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/)).\n\nPRISMS is a secure website that requires a login identifier and password, unlike CRICOS, which is a publicly accessible database ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). While PRISMS is primarily used by education providers, a provider may authorize its agents to create CoEs ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). The Principal Executive Officer (PEO) or an authorized delegate of the provider can grant an agent access to PRISMS for the provider\u2019s courses, allowing the agent to create a CoE or advise on course information ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). If an agent creates a CoE, they can enter the relevant information, but a member of the provider\u2019s staff must authorize it ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)).\n\n### Detailed Explanation of PRISMS\nPRISMS is managed by the Australian Department of Education and is an essential tool for managing and monitoring international student data in Australia ([Meshed Group, 2024](https://meshedgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HigherEdResources/pages/2489057891/PRISMS+Provider+Registration+and+International+Student+Management+System)). It enables education providers to comply with the requirements of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act. The system allows for the electronic issuance of Confirmation of Enrolments (CoEs), which are crucial for student visa applications, and helps track the enrolment status and course progress of international students ([Meshed Group, 2024](https://meshedgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HigherEdResources/pages/2489057891/PRISMS+Provider+Registration+and+International+Student+Management+System)). By ensuring accurate and up-to-date reporting, PRISMS plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of Australia\u2019s international education sector, supporting compliance, and enhancing the overall experience for international students ([Meshed Group, 2024](https://meshedgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HigherEdResources/pages/2489057891/PRISMS+Provider+Registration+and+International+Student+Management+System)).\n\n#### Access and Security\nPRISMS is a secure web site and requires a login identifier and password ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). This differs from CRICOS, which is a publicly accessible database. PRISMS is used by education providers more than agents. However, a provider may give its agent(s) the authority to create CoEs ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). The Principal Executive Officer (PEO) or an authorized delegate of the provider can allow an agent to access PRISMS for that provider\u2019s courses. The agent can then create a CoE or advise on course information ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). If the agent creates a CoE, they can enter relevant information into the CoE form, but a member of the provider\u2019s staff will then authorize the CoE ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)).\n\n#### The Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)\nA CoE is a Confirmation of Enrolment. This is a web-based document created by PRISMS that records which course or courses a student is enrolled in ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)). If a student intends to study more than one course, more than one CoE is produced. This allows the student to get a student visa for the combined length of all the courses, often referred to as a \u2018Package\u2019 visa ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)).\n\nThe steps followed in producing a CoE are:\n1.  The provider agrees to enrol the student ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)).\n2.  The provider authorises and prints a copy of the CoE and provides it to the student and/or agent ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)).\n3.  The information on the CoE is transmitted to DHA via PRISMS ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)).\n4.  When the student applies for a student visa, DHA matches and approves the CoE details ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-2-what-is-a-coe/)).\n\n#### CoE Contents\nA CoE has four parts, including:\n*   **Part A** \u2013 Information for overseas students: where to apply for the student visa ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-3-what-does-a-coe-look-like/)).\n*   **Part B** \u2013 Course details: such as CRICOS code of the provider and the course, course start and finish date or course fee ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-3-what-does-a-coe-look-like/)).\n*   **Part C** \u2013 Student details ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-3-what-does-a-coe-look-like/)).\n*   **Part D** \u2013 Notes: relating the CoE ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-3-what-does-a-coe-look-like/)).\n\n#### Reporting Students Using PRISMS\nEducation agent counsellors are not permitted to create a Student Course Variation (SCV), so this section is for information only ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)). Students are not reported if they follow the same pathway that they originally intended, and the details on their eCoE do not need to be changed in any way ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)). If any changes are necessary, the institution uses PRISMS to produce a Student Course Variation (SCV) ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nGenerally, the following events require an educational provider to use PRISMS to report to the student to DHA:\n*   The student does not begin the course ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n*   The student finishes the course before the date on the CoE ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n*   The student leaves the provider ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nIn these cases, the provider would report on the student using the appropriate SCV code and create new CoEs as required ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)). Depending on the circumstances, the student may or may not need to be directly involved. Students wishing to change providers do not need to approach DIPB unless they are changing the sector of the principal course of study ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nThere are two reasons why an educational provider uses PRISMS to report students to DHA for non-compliance:\n*   Non-attendance in classes ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n*   Unsatisfactory academic performance ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nFor these two reasons, the student is breaching the conditions of their student visa, so during the reporting process, PRISMS generates a formal letter that is sent to the student, asking them to explain their circumstances to DHA ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\n### The Significance of CoE in the Student Visa Application Process\nThe CoE is a mandatory document for international students applying for an Australian student visa ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)). It confirms that the student has been accepted into a CRICOS-registered course and that the educational institution meets the Australian government's standards for quality education and support services for international students ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n\n#### Key Steps in Obtaining a CoE\n1.  **Choose a Course and Institution**: Research and select a CRICOS-registered course and institution ([SWEC Visa, n.d.b](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n2.  **Apply to the Institution**: Complete the application process, either online or offline ([SWEC Visa, n.d.b](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n3.  **Receive the Offer Letter**: If the application is successful, the institution will issue an offer letter ([The Migration, n.d.](https://themigration.com.au/blog/how-to-apply-for-confirmation-of-enrollment-coe-in-australia/)).\n4.  **Accept the Offer and Pay Tuition Fees**: Accept the offer letter and pay the required tuition fees ([MTI, n.d.](https://www.mti.vic.edu.au/international-students/)).\n5.  **Receive the CoE**: Once all conditions are met and fees are paid, the institution will issue the CoE ([MTI, n.d.](https://www.mti.vic.edu.au/international-students/)).\n\n#### Eligibility Criteria for CoE\nTo obtain a CoE, students must meet several eligibility criteria, including:\n*   Having a valid passport ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   Meeting the academic requirements of the course ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   Satisfying any specific entry requirements set by the educational institution ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   Demonstrating a genuine intention to study in Australia, assessed through the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   Providing evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other associated costs ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n*   Obtaining Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for-an-australian-student-visa/)).\n\n### CRICOS and its Relationship with PRISMS\nThe Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) is an online register of all the courses and institutions that are available to students who wish to obtain a student visa ([ICEF, n.d.f](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b5-cricos/)). Institutions offering education or training services to students studying in Australia on student visas are required to comply with the Federal legislative requirements for registration on CRICOS ([ICEF, n.d.f](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b5-cricos/)).\n\nEach institution is given a unique CRICOS Provider Code on registration. This code identifies the institution as a registered provider of education and training services to overseas students ([ICEF, n.d.g](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)). Providers are required by law to include their provider code in all marketing material ([ICEF, n.d.g](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)).\n\nCRICOS is also contained within the PRISMS database ([ICEF, n.d.a](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/)). CRICOS records all of the registered courses for each provider that is registered to provide education to an overseas student studying in Australia on a student visa ([ICEF, n.d.a](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/)).\n\n### Consequences of CoE Cancellation\nThe cancellation of a CoE can have significant implications for international students. If a CoE expires, it becomes invalid for visa purposes, and the student must contact their educational institution to obtain a new CoE ([SWEC Visa, n.d.a](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-get-a-confirmation-of-enrolment-coe-for"

      "full_response": "## Legislation and Regulations in Australia Relating to the Enrolment of International Students: A Detailed Report\n\nThe Australian international education sector is governed by a comprehensive legislative framework designed to protect the interests of overseas students, ensure the quality of education and training, and safeguard Australia's reputation as a leading education provider. Among the options provided, the most accurate answer is **The ESOS Act 2000 and The National Code of Practice 2018**. This report will delve into the specifics of these two critical pieces of legislation, highlighting their roles, objectives, and significance in regulating the enrolment and treatment of international students in Australia.\n\n### The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 is the primary legislation governing the provision of education and training to overseas students in Australia who are studying on a student visa ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md); [b3-the-esos-act.md](b3-the-esos-act.md); [Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)). It establishes a framework to ensure that international students receive the education they have paid for and are supported throughout their studies. The ESOS Act regulates various aspects of international education, including the registration process for providers, their obligations, the Tuition Protection Service (TPS), and enforcement and compliance powers ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)).\n\n#### Objectives of the ESOS Act\n\nThe ESOS Act has three main objectives:\n\n1.  **Financial and Tuition Assurance:** To provide financial and tuition assurance to overseas students for courses they have paid for. This ensures that students receive the tuition they have paid for, and if an educational institution closes, students are provided with alternative tuition or a refund ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md); [b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)).\n\n2.  **Protecting and Enhancing Australia's Reputation:** To protect and enhance Australia\u2019s reputation for quality education and training services. This involves ensuring that the education and training of overseas students meets national standards, student welfare services meet national standards, and education providers act ethically and with integrity ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)).\n\n3.  **Complementing Migration Laws:** To complement Australia\u2019s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of laws relating to student visas. This ensures that education institutions do not allow or encourage students to breach their student visa conditions ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)).\n\n#### Key Provisions of the ESOS Act\n\n*   **Registration of Providers:** The ESOS Act mandates that all institutions offering courses to international students must be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([ESOS Act | Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/esos-act); [Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) legislative framework | UniSC | University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia](https://www.usc.edu.au/about/careers-at-unisc/staff/education-services-for-overseas-students-esos-legislative-framework)). CRICOS registration ensures that institutions meet specific standards for quality and student support.\n\n*   **Tuition Protection Service (TPS):** The ESOS Act established the TPS to assist international students if their education provider is unable to deliver a course of study. The TPS ensures that students are either placed in an alternative course or receive a refund of their unspent tuition fees ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md); [ESOS Act | Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/esos-act)).\n\n*   **Provider Responsibilities:** The ESOS Act places several responsibilities on registered providers, including providing accurate marketing information, ensuring students are appropriately qualified for their chosen courses, and having written agreements with students that protect their rights and set out the responsibilities of each party ([b3-the-esos-act.md](b3-the-esos-act.md); [b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n*   **Agent Responsibilities:** Under the ESOS Act, providers are responsible for the actions of their education agents. Providers must ensure that agents act honestly, in good faith, and in the best interests of the student ([b3-the-esos-act.md](b3-the-esos-act.md)).\n\n### The National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) is a legislative instrument made under the ESOS Act 2000 ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md); [National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)). It sets nationally consistent standards to support providers in delivering quality education and training to overseas students. The National Code 2018 commenced on 1 January 2018, and education providers must comply with it to maintain their registration to provide education services to overseas students ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md); [National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)).\n\n#### Objectives of the National Code 2018\n\nThe objectives of the National Code 2018 are to:\n\n*   Support the ESOS framework.\n*   Safeguard Australia\u2019s international reputation as a provider of high-quality education and training.\n*   Protect the interests of overseas students.\n*   Support registered providers in monitoring student compliance with Student visa conditions ([Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) legislative framework | UniSC | University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia](https://www.usc.edu.au/about/careers-at-unisc/staff/education-services-for-overseas-students-esos-legislative-framework); [ESOS Framework | Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA)](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework)).\n\n#### Key Standards of the National Code 2018\n\nThe National Code 2018 comprises 11 standards that cover various aspects of the international student experience ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md); [b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)):\n\n1.  **Marketing Information and Practices:** Ensures that the marketing of courses and services is not false or misleading ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n2.  **Recruitment of an Overseas Student:** Sets out that registered providers must recruit responsibly by ensuring students are appropriately qualified for the course for which they seek enrolment ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n3.  **Formalisation of Enrolment and Written Agreements:** Requires registered providers to formalise enrolment through written agreements that protect the rights and set out the responsibilities of each party ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n4.  **Education Agents:** Registered education providers must ensure that their education agents act ethically, honestly, and in the best interests of overseas students ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md); [b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md)).\n\n5.  **Younger Overseas Students:** Addresses the specific needs and welfare of students under 18 years of age ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md)).\n\n6.  **Overseas Student Support Services:** Requires registered providers to assist overseas students to adjust to study and life in Australia and have appropriate orientation programs ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n7.  **Overseas Student Transfers:** Sets conditions for when a registered provider can enrol an overseas student wishing to transfer from another provider ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n8.  **Overseas Student Visa Requirements:** Requires registered providers to safeguard the integrity of Australia\u2019s migration laws by supporting overseas students to complete their course within the required duration and fulfil their visa requirements ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n9.  **Deferring, Suspending, or Cancelling the Overseas Student\u2019s Enrolment:** Sets out that registered providers must appropriately manage the enrolment of their overseas students and ensure all necessary information has been provided to the relevant government department ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n10. **Complaints and Appeals:** Requires registered providers to have mechanisms for addressing student complaints and appeals ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n\n11. **Additional Requirements:** Covers any other requirements deemed necessary to ensure student welfare and quality education ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md)).\n\n#### How the National Code Relates to Agents\n\nThe National Code directly relates to education agents, as an agent\u2019s behavior is the direct responsibility of the education provider ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md); [b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md)). If an agent makes a mistake or behaves dishonestly, the education provider will be held responsible for their actions. The National Code 2018 requires that providers have a written agreement with all education agents they engage to formally represent them. The agreement must contain corrective actions and termination conditions ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md)).\n\n### Other Relevant Legislation and Regulations\n\nWhile the ESOS Act 2000 and the National Code of Practice 2018 are the primary pieces of legislation governing international students, other laws and regulations also play a role:\n\n*   **The Migration Act 1958:** This Act and associated migration regulations govern the issuing of Student, Tourist, and other visas ([b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)). The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is responsible for administering this Act. To obtain a student visa, students must intend to study a CRICOS-registered course, have a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), demonstrate financial capacity, have appropriate academic background and English language proficiency, and demonstrate they are a genuine temporary entrant ([b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the legislative and regulatory framework in Australia relating to the enrolment of international students is primarily governed by the **ESOS Act 2000 and the National Code of Practice 2018**. These instruments work in tandem to ensure the quality of education, protect the interests of international students, and maintain Australia's reputation as a leading destination for international education. While the Migration Act 1958 also plays a role in visa issuance, the ESOS Act and the National Code are the most directly relevant to the enrolment and treatment of international students within the Australian education system.

      "full_response": "Here's a comprehensive report addressing the query, adhering to the specified guidelines and incorporating relevant information from the provided sources.\n\n## Report on PRISMS Reporting Obligations for Educational Institutions\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) is a critical tool utilized by Australian educational institutions to communicate information about international students to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) ([b6-1-access-to-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-1-access-to-prisms/)). This system ensures compliance with the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act and the National Code of Practice, which safeguard the integrity of Australia's migration laws and the quality of education provided to overseas students ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)). Registered providers are obligated to maintain updated information in PRISMS regarding student enrolments, visa conditions, and course progress ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)). This report aims to determine which of the provided circumstances\u2014student non-attendance, failure to meet course requirements, or a one-week extension of an ELICOS course due to approved vacation\u2014are *not* reported through PRISMS.\n\n**Analysis of Reporting Obligations**\n\nTo accurately address the query, it is essential to examine the specific reporting requirements outlined in the National Code and related guidelines. The following analysis breaks down each circumstance and its corresponding reporting obligations:\n\n**A. Student Non-Attendance**\n\nEducational providers are required to monitor student attendance to ensure compliance with visa conditions ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)). Specifically, students are generally expected to attend at least 80% of their scheduled lessons ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)). When a student's attendance falls below this threshold, the provider must take specific actions, including notifying the student of their intention to report them to DHA ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\nThe National Code provides some flexibility in reporting non-attendance. Providers may choose not to report a breach if the student's attendance is at least 70%, they are maintaining satisfactory academic performance, and the decision aligns with the provider's documented attendance policies and procedures ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)). Compassionate or compelling circumstances may also be considered ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)). However, if a student's attendance falls below 70%, the provider must issue a notice of intention to report the student for unsatisfactory attendance ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\nIf the student does not access the complaints and appeals process within 20 working days, withdraws from the process, or the process results in a decision supporting the provider, the provider must notify the Secretary of DEEWR through PRISMS that the student is not achieving satisfactory attendance as soon as practicable ([National Code Part D, Standard 11](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD11.aspx)).\n\n**Conclusion:** Student non-attendance, particularly when it falls below established thresholds and does not meet the criteria for non-reporting, is a reportable event in PRISMS.\n\n**B. Students Failing to Meet Course Requirements**\n\nRegistered providers must safeguard the integrity of Australia\u2019s migration laws by supporting overseas students to complete their course within the required duration and fulfill their visa requirements for course attendance and course progress ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)). Unsatisfactory academic performance is one of the two reasons why an educational provider uses PRISMS to report students to DHA for non-compliance ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nThe education provider must have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory course progress ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)). The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. The letter must also inform the student they have 20 working days within which to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)). Once this timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalised and found in favour of the provider; the provider reports the visa breach using PRISMS ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\n**Conclusion:** Students failing to meet course requirements, particularly after the exhaustion of internal appeals processes, is a reportable event in PRISMS.\n\n**C. Students Finishing Their ELICOS Course One Week Later Due to Approved Vacation**\n\nThis scenario requires a nuanced understanding of PRISMS reporting. The critical factor is whether the student's Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) needs to be changed. If the student follows the same pathway that they originally intended and the details on their eCoE do not need to be changed in any way, students are not reported ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nHowever, if any changes are necessary, the institution uses PRISMS to produce a Student Course Variation (SCV) ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)). Generally, the following events require an educational provider to use PRISMS to report to the student to DHA: The student finishes the course before the date on the CoE ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)). The student leaves the provider ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms/)).\n\nIf the student is finishing their ELICOS course one week *later* due to approved vacation, this implies that the course end date on the original CoE is no longer accurate. In this case, the provider would need to update the CoE to reflect the new course end date. This update is done through PRISMS.\n\n**Conclusion:** Students finishing their ELICOS course one week later due to approved vacation *does* require reporting through PRISMS, specifically to update the CoE with the new course end date.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n\n*   **Students non-attendance:** Reportable through PRISMS.\n*   **Students failing to meet course requirements:** Reportable through PRISMS.\n*   **Students finishing their ELICOS course one week later due to approved vacation:** Reportable through PRISMS, as it necessitates a CoE update.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Both B and C** is incorrect. All the options are reportable through PRISMS.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo ensure compliance with PRISMS reporting obligations, educational institutions should:\n\n1.  **Develop and maintain a comprehensive PRISMS compliance policy:** This policy should outline the processes, responsibilities, and deadlines for reporting in PRISMS ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/essential-prisms-compliance-guide-avoid-costly-mistakes-and-stay-esos-compliant-a-must-read-for-all-rtos/)).\n2.  **Provide regular staff training:** Staff responsible for handling PRISMS data must understand the ESOS Act's requirements and the importance of accurate, timely reporting ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/essential-prisms-compliance-guide-avoid-costly-mistakes-and-stay-esos-compliant-a-must-read-for-all-rtos/)).\n3.  **Conduct regular audits of PRISMS entries:** This will help ensure accuracy and timeliness ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/essential-prisms-compliance-guide-avoid-costly-mistakes-and-stay-esos-compliant-a-must-read-for-all-rtos/)).\n4.  **Automate reminders:** Implement automated systems to remind staff of reporting deadlines ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/essential-prisms-compliance-guide-avoid-costly-mistakes-and-stay-esos-compliant-a-must-read-for-all-rtos/)).\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, educational institutions can minimize the risk of non-compliance and ensure the smooth running of their operations.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n*   b2-3-cricos.md.

      "full_response": "## Report on the Implications of a Student's Illness and Failure to Provide Current Address\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the scenario of an international student in Australia who has been hospitalized due to illness and has not provided their education provider with a current address. The query focuses on the potential consequences of this situation, specifically regarding the student's visa status and access to necessary communications. This report will analyze the provided information to determine the most likely outcome and provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant factors.\n\n**Analysis of Potential Consequences**\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely consequence of the student's failure to provide a current address is that they will not receive any letters about their possible non-compliance with visa conditions. This conclusion is drawn from several key points within the provided documentation.\n\n*   **Address Notification Requirement:** Student visa holders are obligated to inform their education provider of their current address in Australia within seven days of arriving and to update any change of address within seven days of moving ([KangarooEdu.au, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). This requirement is explicitly stated in multiple sources ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](no link)), ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Formal Notices:** Education providers send all formal notices to the student's registered address ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Reporting to DHA:** Education providers are required to have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory course progress ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)). If a student fails to meet these requirements, the provider must issue a written notification of their intention to report the student to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **PRISMS Reporting:** Once the timeframe for appeals has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalized in favor of the provider, the provider reports the visa breach using the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **DHA Notification:** After a visa breach is reported, the student will then receive a notice informing them that they must attend an Immigration office within 28 days. Should they not do this, their visa may be cancelled ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Consequences of Not Receiving Notices:** If the student has not provided the institution with a current postal address, the formal letter may not reach the student. Consequently, the student may not realize that an appointment is necessary ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](no link)). In this situation, the student visa is still at risk of being cancelled, because it is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure the provider has their current postal address ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](no link)).\n\n**Why Other Options Are Less Likely**\n\n*   **The hospital is unable to release the student from hospital:** While privacy concerns exist regarding the release of medical information, the hospital's ability to release the student is not directly contingent on the student's address being updated with the education provider. Medical authorities will communicate with the student's parents, spouse, or husband unless the student has expressed a wish for them not to ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](no link)). The hospital will also communicate with the student directly.\n*   **The student will be deported from Australia for not providing current information to its education provider:** While failing to update the address is a breach of visa conditions, deportation is not an automatic consequence. The student will first receive a notice to attend a DHA office, and only if they fail to do so will their visa be at risk of cancellation ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **The student will not be believed when he tells the institution he was sick:** The student's credibility regarding their illness is not directly affected by their failure to update their address. If the student has a valid reason for non-compliance, such as being sick, and can provide medical certificates to prove this, DHA may decide not to cancel the visa ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](no link)).\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Visa Conditions:** It is essential that every agent informs their students of the need to comply with their visa conditions. If a student does not comply, their visa may be cancelled and they may need to return home ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](no link)). There is also a three-year ban (exclusion period) on re-entry to Australia if a visa is cancelled for breaching visa conditions ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Student Responsibilities:** Students must maintain enrolment in a full-time registered course, satisfy their provider\u2019s requirements for attendance and course progress, and maintain adequate health insurance ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Education Provider Responsibilities:** The education provider must approve arrangements, including when arrangements change, if the student is under 18 and their welfare arrangements are approved through the education provider ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](no link)).\n*   **Privacy:** Agents working in Australia are subject to privacy laws and need to understand how information about individuals can be used ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](no link)).\n*   **Changes to Student Visas in 2025:** As of January 1, 2025, all Australian student visa applications must include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), replacing Letters of Offer ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Onshore applications without CoEs are invalid, and students risk losing lawful status if current visas expire before meeting requirements ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nGiven the potential consequences, the following actions are recommended:1.  **Immediate Action:** The education provider should attempt to contact the student through all available means (e.g., phone, email, emergency contact details) to ascertain their current location and condition.\n2.  **Address Update:** Once contact is established, the student should immediately update their address with the education provider.\n3.  **Explanation and Documentation:** The student should provide a written explanation for their failure to update their address, along with supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificates) to demonstrate that their hospitalization prevented them from fulfilling this requirement.\n4.  **Legal Advice:** The student should seek legal advice from a migration expert to understand their rights and obligations and to ensure that they take all necessary steps to protect their visa status.\n5.  **Education Provider Support:** The education provider should provide support to the student, including guidance on the visa requirements and assistance with the address update process.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the student's hospitalization is a serious matter, the most immediate consequence of their failure to provide a current address is the risk of not receiving critical communications from their education provider and the DHA regarding potential visa breaches. This can lead to further complications and potentially jeopardize their ability to remain in Australia. By taking prompt action to update their address, provide an explanation for their non-compliance, and seek legal advice, the student can mitigate these risks and ensure that their visa status is protected.\n\n**References**\n\n*   VisaVerge.com.

Based on the information provided, the most accurate response is: The student should be able to transfer to another school in Australia because their status as an international student is protected by the ESOS Act 2000 and the Tuition Protection Service (TPS).\n\n### Legal Framework: ESOS Act 2000 and the National Code\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 is the primary legislation governing the provision of education and training to international students in Australia who hold a student visa ([International Education, 2025](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)). The ESOS Act ensures that registered providers meet nationally consistent standards in education delivery, facilities, and services, and it offers tuition fee protection for international students ([Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Framework, 2025](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n\nThe ESOS Act has three main objectives:\n1.  To provide financial and tuition assurance to overseas students for courses they have paid for ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n2.  Making sure that students receive the tuition they have paid for.\n3.  If an educational institution closes, a student is provided with alternative tuition or be given a refund ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n\nTo achieve the intended purposes of the ESOS Act, the legislation also provides a National Code of Practice ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b4-the-national-code-of-practice/)). The National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 sets nationally consistent standards and procedures for registered providers ([Study, 2025](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/study-with-us/esos-protecting-your-rights)). Education providers must comply with the National Code to maintain their registration to provide education services to overseas students ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b4-the-national-code-of-practice/)).\n\n### Tuition Protection Service (TPS)\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is an Australian Government initiative designed to assist international students whose education providers are unable to fully deliver their course of study ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). The TPS ensures that international students are able to either:\n\n*   Complete their studies in another course or with another education provider, or\n*   Receive a refund of their unspent tuition fees ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\nThe TPS is activated when a provider defaults, meaning they fail to meet their obligations to provide the program ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). In such cases, the provider must either refund the unexpended portion of prepaid tuition fees or offer an alternative place, accepted in writing by the student ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). The TPS gives students control and responsibility within the placement process by allowing students to make a choice from available alternative placement options ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Procedures Following a Provider Closure\n\nWhen an education institution closes, the TPS and the Australian Government work to ensure that all students are placed in a suitable alternative course ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). For example, if a college closes and cannot provide a refund or alternative course, students will be offered a place in the same or a similar course with other colleges in the same area, at no extra cost, enabling them to complete their studies ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\nIf a student is affected by the closure and needs to apply for a new student visa to continue their studies, they may be eligible for an exemption from paying the student visa application fee ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). This exemption may also extend to a guardian holding a Student Guardian visa (subclass 580) ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Steps for Agents and Students\n\nIf an institution closes, agents should refer affected students to the Tuition Protection Service ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). Students should also:\n\n1.  **Seek Support:** Notify their education agents immediately ([Raposas, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n2.  **Update ImmiAccount:** Once a new course is secured, update visa information via ImmiAccount to reflect the new provider and course details ([Raposas, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n3.  **Gather Academic Records:** Collect all necessary documentation from the closing school ([Raposas, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n\n### International House (IH) Closure Example\n\nThe closure of International House (IH) Sydney in December 2024 provides a recent example of how the TPS operates ([International House (IH) closure - what does this mean international student visa-holders?, 2024](https://www.internationalstudentaustralia.com.au/news-and-updates/international-house-ih-closure-international-students)). Following the closure, the administrator had 14 days to meet obligations under the ESOS Act, including offering students a place in an alternative course or providing a refund of unspent tuition fees ([News - English Australia, 2024](https://www.englishaustralia.com.au/news/closure-of-international-house-sydney-tps-update)). The TPS then assessed the situation and engaged with students to process claims for refunds ([News - English Australia, 2024](https://www.englishaustralia.com.au/news/closure-of-international-house-sydney-tps-update)).\n\n### Student Visa Considerations\n\nA student visa remains valid if a school closes; however, it is crucial to remain compliant with visa conditions, which include being enrolled in a registered course ([Raposas, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)). Students have a limited time to enroll in a new course, and failure to do so could affect their visa, potentially leading to cancellation ([Raposas, 2024](https://pathwaytoaus.com/general/school-closed-a-guide-for-international-student-in-australia/)).\n\n### Prepaid Tuition Fees\n\nThe ESOS legislation limits the amount of prepaid tuition fees a provider can demand from a student before they commence their course to 50%, unless the course is 24 weeks or less, in which case they can require 100% of the fees to be paid ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)). Providers not administered by a state authority or eligible for recurrent Commonwealth funding (i.e., Private Providers) must keep any initial prepaid tuition fees in a designated account before the student commences the course ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Limitations on International Student Intake for 2025\n\nWhile not directly related to school closures, it's important to note that the Australian government has proposed a cap of 270,000 new international student commencements for the year 2025, aiming to restore numbers to pre-pandemic levels ([a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-5-international-student-numbers/)). This cap will apply to both higher education and vocational education sectors, excluding primary and secondary schools as well as standalone English-language providers ([a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-5-international-student-numbers/)). Public universities will have a combined cap of approximately 145,000 new international students, while the vocational education sector is allocated 95,000 spots, and private universities and non-higher education providers will receive around 30,000 places ([a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-5-international-student-numbers/)). However, this cap is facing political opposition and may not be implemented ([Visaverge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-international-student-caps-plan-faces-blockade/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the ESOS Act 2000 and the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) provide a safety net for international students in Australia in the event of an education provider closure. The student should be able to transfer to another school in Australia because their status as an international student is protected by the ESOS Act 2000 and the Tuition Protection Service (TPS). The student is entitled to either complete their studies in an alternative course or receive a refund of their unspent tuition fees. Agents play a crucial role in guiding students through this process and ensuring they are aware of their rights and responsibilities.\n\n### References\n\n*   [a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-5-international-student-numbers/)\n*   [b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)\n*   [b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)\n*   [b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b4-the-national-code-of-practice/)\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Framework.

      "full_response": "## The Tuition Protection Service and its Legislative Foundation: An In-Depth Analysis\n\nThe Australian international education sector is underpinned by a robust regulatory framework designed to protect the interests of overseas students. A key component of this framework is the Tuition Protection Service (TPS), a vital safety net for international students whose education providers are unable to fully deliver their course of study. Understanding the legislative basis of the TPS is crucial for education agents, providers, and students alike. This report will analyze the legislative foundation of the TPS, focusing on the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 as its primary source.\n\n### The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000: The Cornerstone of Tuition Protection\n\nBased on the provided information, the Tuition Protection Service is outlined in **The ESOS Act 2000**. This Act is the primary legislation regulating international education in Australia, establishing the framework for protecting international students and ensuring the quality of education services ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)).\n\nThe ESOS Act 2000 governs several critical aspects of international education, including:\n\n*   The registration process and obligations of registered providers ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n*   The Tuition Protection Service (TPS) ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md), [internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n*   Enforcement and compliance powers ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md), [internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n\nThe ESOS Act's primary objective is to provide financial and tuition assurance to overseas students for courses they have paid for. This includes ensuring students receive the tuition they have paid for and providing alternative tuition or refunds if an educational institution closes ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)). The Act also aims to protect and enhance Australia's reputation for quality education and training services and complement Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to student visas ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](b2-1-the-esos-act.md)).\n\n### The Tuition Protection Service (TPS): A Safety Net for International Students\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is an Australian Government initiative established under the ESOS Act 2000 to assist international students whose education providers are unable to fully deliver their course of study ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)). The TPS ensures that international students can either complete their studies in another course or with another education provider or receive a refund of their unspent tuition fees ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)).\n\nThe TPS operates as a mechanism to place students when a provider fails to meet its obligations to provide the program, which is termed a \"provider default\" ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)). A provider default occurs when an education provider closes, fails to start a course, or stops offering a course to enrolled students ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\nIn the event of a provider default, the provider must either refund affected students the unexpended portion of their prepaid tuition fees or offer an alternative place, which is accepted in writing by the student ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)). The TPS gives students control and responsibility within the placement process by allowing them to choose from available alternative placement options ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)).\n\n### Provider and Student Obligations Under the ESOS Act\n\nThe ESOS Act outlines specific obligations for both providers and students. Providers must report provider and student defaults to the TPS Director and the Secretary ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md)).\n\nFollowing a provider default, a provider must fulfill its obligations under sections 46A-46F of the ESOS Act, including:\n\n*   Giving written notice of the default to the relevant ESOS agency and the TPS Director within three business days of the default occurring ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   Giving written notice of the default to the students in relation to whom the provider has defaulted ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   Discharging its obligations to students within the provider obligation period of 14 days after the default day by either arranging for students to be offered a place in an alternative course (and the student accepting that offer in writing) or providing a refund of unspent tuition fees ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   Notifying the relevant ESOS agency and the TPS Director of the outcome of discharge of obligations within seven days after the end of the provider obligation period ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n\nUnder section 47A of the ESOS Act, an overseas student or intending overseas student defaults if:\n\n*   The student does not start the course on the agreed starting day (and has not previously withdrawn) ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   The student withdraws from the course at the location (either before or after the agreed starting day) ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   The provider refuses to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student at the location because the student failed to pay an amount they were liable to pay the provider, breached a condition of their student visa, or engaged in misbehavior ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n\nFollowing a student default, a provider must fulfill its obligations under sections 47A-47H of the ESOS Act, including providing a refund to the defaulted student in accordance with either section 47D or 47E of the ESOS Act within the provider obligation period of four weeks and, if a refund was provided to a defaulted student under section 47E of the ESOS Act, notifying the relevant ESOS agency and the TPS Director of the outcome of discharge of obligations within seven days after the end of the provider obligation period ([education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n\n### The National Code of Practice 2018\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (The National Code) is another crucial component of the ESOS framework ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md)). It sets out the standards that education providers must meet to maintain their registration to provide education services to overseas students ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md)). The National Code is found in Part 4, Division 2 of the ESOS Act ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md)).\n\n### Amendments to the ESOS Act\n\nThe ESOS Act has been amended several times since its inception in 2000 to strengthen the protection of international students and improve the regulation of the international education sector ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)). Recent amendments include:\n\n*   The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Act 2012 ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n*   The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Act 2012 ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n*   The Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012 ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students legislation Amendment Act 2011 ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n\nThese amendments have focused on strengthening the registration requirements of education providers, introducing a consistent risk management approach to the regulation of international education, and extending the range of non-compliant behavior that could attract financial penalties ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ESOS Act 2000 is the legislative foundation of the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) and the broader regulatory framework for international education in Australia. It establishes the rights and responsibilities of education providers and international students and provides a safety net for students in the event of a provider default. Education agents, providers, and students must understand the ESOS Act and the National Code to ensure compliance and protect the interests of international students. The TPS is a critical component of this framework, providing tuition protection and supporting the integrity of the student visa program. The Australian Government, through the Department of Education, administers the ESOS Act and its associated instruments, ensuring the quality and protection of international education in Australia ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)).\n\n### References\n\nb2-1-the-esos-act.md\nb3-2-protection-for-international-students.md\nb4-the-national-code-of-practice.md\neducation.gov.au, \"About the Tuition Protection Services (TPS) - Department of Education, Australian Government\" [https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)\neducation.gov.au, \"International Providers - Department of Education, Australian Government\" [https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)\ninternationaleducation.gov.au, \"Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act\" [https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx)"

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Application Locations: A Detailed Report\n\nThe process of obtaining a student visa is a crucial step for international students aspiring to study in Australia or the USA. Understanding where to apply and the specific requirements is essential for a smooth and successful application. This report aims to identify the correct location for lodging a student visa application, drawing upon information from provided documents and web sources.\n\n**Opinion:** Based on the information provided, the correct location for a student to apply for an Australian student visa is **online through the DHA (Department of Home Affairs) website**.\n\n### Australian Student Visa Application Process and Locations\n\nThe primary authority for Australian student visas is the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) ([Department of Home Affairs (DHA)|](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)). The DHA controls and maintains Australia\u2019s visa requirements, and it is the main point of contact for any visa-related issues ([Department of Home Affairs (DHA)|](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n\n#### Online Application via ImmiAccount\n\nThe most consistent and emphasized method for lodging a student visa application is through the DHA's online portal, ImmiAccount ([Lodging An Application via immiAccount](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)). Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the online application process:\n\n1.  **Create an ImmiAccount**: All agents and students should create an online account on the ImmiAccount portal to lodge applications ([Lodging An Application via immiAccount](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n2.  **Start a New Application**: After logging in, select the \"My applications\" tab and click \"New Application\" ([Lodging An Application via immiAccount](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n3.  **Select Application Type**: From the application group, select the applicable student visa type ([Lodging An Application via immiAccount](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n4.  **Terms and Conditions**: Read and agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding ([Step 6](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n5.  **Answer Questions**: Answer all the questions in the application form and click \"Next\" after each section ([Step 7](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n6.  **Review and Payment**: Review the completed application and proceed to make the payment. As of July 1, 2024, the base application fee for student visas is AUD $1,600, with additional fees for applicants over and under 18 ([Points to Note](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md), [As of July 1, 2024](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n7.  **Submit Application**: Click \"Submit Now\" to submit the application ([Step 9](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n8.  **Payment Details**: Enter payment details and click \"Submit\" ([Step 10](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n9.  **Confirmation**: Confirm the payment and click \"Next\" to view a summary of the application ([Step 12](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n10. **Go to My Account**: Click \"Go to my account\" to see the updated status of the application ([Step 13](b8-1-the-student-visa-application-process.md)).\n\n#### Role of Education Agents\n\nMany students opt to use education agents to assist with their visa application process ([Apply for your visa on the DHA website](https://www.acu.edu.au/international-students/arriving-and-living-in-Australia/applying-for-your-student-visa)). These agents are experienced in making international student applications and can communicate with the DHA on behalf of the student ([Education agents](https://study.csu.edu.au/international/live-and-work/student-visa)). Education agents can help with:\n\n*   Preparation and review of the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) statement ([Their Student Visa Application service includes:](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/student-visa-australia)).\n*   Drafting the application form and collecting necessary data ([Their Student Visa Application service includes:](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/student-visa-australia)).\n*   Ensuring all documents are correct ([Their Student Visa Application service includes:](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/student-visa-australia)).\n*   Organizing Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) insurance if required ([Their Student Visa Application service includes:](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/student-visa-australia)).\n*   Processing the visa application and coordinating any additional information requests ([Their Student Visa Application service includes:](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/student-visa-australia)).\n\n#### Key Requirements for a Student Visa\n\nTo obtain an Australian student visa, applicants must meet several criteria ([B7. Student Visas: Basic Requirements and Processes](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)):\n\n*   **Acceptance into Full-Time Study**: The student must be accepted into a full-time study program ([The student must be accepted into full-time study](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)).\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE)**: The student must be a genuine temporary entrant, intending to stay in Australia temporarily for the purpose of study ([Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE)](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Health and Health Insurance**: The student must meet health requirements and have adequate health insurance, typically OSHC (Overseas Student Health Cover) ([The student must meet health and health insurance requirements](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)).\n*   **Good Character**: The student must be of good character and not have any debts to the Australian Government ([The student must have a \u201cgood\u201d character and not have any debts to the Australian Government](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)).\n*   **Financial Capacity**: The student must demonstrate the financial capacity to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other costs ([The student must have the appropriate financial capacity to study in Australia](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)). As of 2025, demonstrating sufficient financial resources is pivotal to application approval ([Budget Accordingly:](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **English Language Proficiency**: The student must demonstrate appropriate English language skills ([The student must demonstrate appropriate English language skills](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)). A minimum score of 6.0 is generally required for most applicants ([The English language proficiency requirement for student visas has increased](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)**: As of January 1, 2025, all student visa applications must include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from an Australian educational institution ([1. Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). The DHA will no longer accept Letters of Offer as proof of admission ([1. Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n\n#### Changes in 2025\n\nSeveral changes to the student visa process have been implemented in 2025 to ensure visa integrity and attract genuine international students ([Australia changes rules for student visas: Check new requirement for a student visa application](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). Key updates include:\n\n*   **Mandatory CoE**: All student visa applications must include a CoE ([1. Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)).\n*   **Increased Financial Costs**: Upfront costs, including tuition fees required for the CoE and the application fee of AUD 1,600, must be considered ([Budget Accordingly:](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Restrictions on Onshore Applications**: Onshore applications without CoEs are invalid ([Onshore applications without CoEs are invalid](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n### USA Student Visa Application Process and Locations\n\nFor students interested in studying in the USA, the process and locations for applying for a student visa are different. The primary visa for academic studies is the F-1 visa ([F1 Visa](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n\n#### Types of US Student Visas\n\n*   **F-1 Visa**: For full-time students at universities (undergraduate and graduate) ([F1 Visa](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **J-1 Visa**: For exchange visitors such as scholars or students in short-term programs ([J1 Visa](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   **M-1 Visa**: For students attending vocational or non-academic programs ([M1 Visa](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n#### Application Steps\n\n1.  **Acceptance at a SEVP-Approved School**: You must be accepted into a US institution approved by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) ([Acceptance at a US institution approved by SEVP.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n2.  **Receive Form I-20**: Upon acceptance, your school will provide you with a Form I-20, \"Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status\" ([Form I-20](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n3.  **Pay the SEVIS Fee**: Pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee ([Pay the SEVIS Fee](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n4.  **Complete the DS-160 Form**: Fill out the Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application (DS-160) ([Fill out the DS-160 form](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n5.  **Schedule a Visa Interview**: Schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in your country ([Visa Interview scheduled at the US Embassy or Consulate.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n6.  **Attend the Visa Interview**: Attend the visa interview with all required documents ([Attend the Visa Interview](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n\n#### Locations for Application\n\nThe application process for a US student visa is primarily online, but it requires in-person attendance for the visa interview. Indian students, for example, need to visit the biometric and US visa interview centers to complete their USA student visa process ([Where to Apply for a US Student Visa?](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n\n#### Required Documents\n\n*   Valid passport ([A\u00a0valid passport.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   DS-160 confirmation ([DS-160 confirmation.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   SEVIS fee receipt ([SEVIS fee receipt.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   Form I-20 from your university ([Form I-20\u00a0from your university.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n*   Financial documents proving your ability to pay for your studies ([Financial documents Proving your ability to pay for your studies.](https://www.spscanada.com/blog/usa-student-visa-guide-2025-all-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information, the correct answer to the query is: **Online through the DHA website**. The Australian student visa application process is primarily conducted online through the Department of Home Affairs' ImmiAccount portal. While education agents and other resources can assist with the application, the final submission is made online. The process for US student visas involves both online application and in-person interviews at US embassies or consulates.\n\n### References\n\nACU International.

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the query about the requirements for obtaining an Australian student visa, focusing on the role of knowledge about Australian history, language, and culture:\n\n### Report: Requirements for Obtaining an Australian Student Visa\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) in Australia sets specific criteria for international students seeking to study in the country. These requirements are designed to ensure that applicants are genuine students who intend to study and abide by visa conditions. This report aims to identify which of the listed elements is *not* a requirement for obtaining a student visa, based on available documentation. The options include: a valid passport, financial ability, English proficiency, and knowledge of Australian history, language, and culture.\n\n**Core Requirements for an Australian Student Visa**\n\nBased on the provided documents and web sources, the DHA requires several key criteria to be met for a student visa application to be successful. These include:\n\n1.  **Acceptance into Full-Time Study**: The student must be accepted into a registered course of study in Australia ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)).\n\n2.  **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement**: As of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement was replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement. This involves answering targeted questions to provide clearer insights into the applicant's intentions and circumstances ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)). Navitas notes that the DHA requires all applicants to complete a Genuine Student form at the visa submission stage ([Navitas Genuine Student Assessment information - Navitas](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/)).\n\n3.  **Health and Health Insurance**: Applicants must meet health requirements and have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of their stay ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)). Study Australia emphasizes that failure to provide proof of OSHC will result in visa refusal ([How to apply for your visa | Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)).\n\n4.  **Good Character**: Applicants must demonstrate good character and not have any debts to the Australian Government ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)).\n\n5.  **Financial Capacity**: Students must prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)). As of 2024, the minimum funds required are AUD$29,710 for a single student ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)).\n\n6.  **English Language Skills**: Students must demonstrate appropriate English language skills ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)).\n\n7.  **Age Requirements**: Students must be of the appropriate age ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)).\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Each Requirement**\n\n*   **A Valid Passport**: A valid passport is essential for international travel and serves as proof of identity and nationality. It is a fundamental requirement for visa applications, including the Australian student visa ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)).\n\n*   **Financial Ability**: The DHA requires evidence of financial capacity to ensure that students can cover their expenses without becoming a burden on the Australian community. Acceptable evidence includes bank statements, government loans, and scholarships ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)). StudyGurus emphasizes the importance of demonstrating a genuine and close connection with the person providing financial support ([How to show Minimum Financial Evidence for your student visa](https://studygurus.com.au/minimum-financial-evidence-for-your-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n*   **English Proficiency**: Demonstrating English proficiency is crucial for students to succeed in their studies and integrate into the Australian community. The DHA accepts various English proficiency tests, such as IELTS, TOEFL, and PTE ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)). EIA notes that the Australian government is elevating English language proficiency standards for Student and Temporary Graduate visas, with minimum test scores increasing as of March 23, 2024 ([Recent Changes on Australian Migration Strategy and Student Visas Requirements - EIA](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)).\n\n*   **Knowledge of Australian History, Language, and Culture**: While the DHA requires students to be genuine and intend to study in Australia, there is no explicit requirement for them to demonstrate knowledge of Australian history, language, and culture. The focus is on their intention to study, financial capacity, and English proficiency.\n\n**Exemptions and Special Cases**\n\nThere are specific exemptions to the English language proficiency requirements for certain students, such as those from English-speaking countries or those enrolled in specific courses like ELICOS or postgraduate research ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)). Additionally, secondary exchange students have specific financial evidence and welfare arrangement options ([b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/)).\n\n**Integrity Concerns and DHA Scrutiny**\n\nThe DHA has increased scrutiny on student visa applications to identify genuine students and address integrity concerns. Examples of integrity concerns include providing false information about English language skills, family background, or financial support ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha/)). EIA reports that a $19 million investment was placed in the Home Affairs student visa unit to raise the scrutiny for high-risk student visas ([Recent Changes on Australian Migration Strategy and Student Visas Requirements - EIA](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the information provided, the element that is *not* explicitly required by the DHA for an individual to obtain a student visa is:\n\n*   Providing appropriate information about the individual's knowledge of the history, language, and culture of Australia.\n\nWhile demonstrating a genuine intention to study is crucial, the DHA does not mandate that applicants possess specific knowledge of Australian history, language, or culture. The focus is primarily on their academic qualifications, financial stability, English proficiency, and genuine intent to study in Australia.\n\n**References**\n\n*   a2-australia.md\n*   b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\n*   b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md\n*   b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md\n*   b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md\n*   b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns.md\n*   b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\n*   b9-4-visas-following-study.md\n*   c3-1-before-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   [Amber Student Visa Guide](https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/australia-student-visa-guide)\n*   [Blue Education Financial Evidence](https://www.blueeducation.com.au/post/what-is-an-acceptable-financial-evidence-for-an-australian-student-visa-application)\n*   [Deakin College English Requirements](https://www.deakincollege.edu.au/how-apply/international/english-requirements/)\n*   [EIA Recent Changes](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)\n*   [Intl Students Australia Updates](https://intlstudents.com.au/updates-to-english-language-requirements-for-subclass-500-student-visas/)\n*   [Leverage Edu Documents](https://leverageedu.com/learn/documents-required-for-student-visa-australia/)\n*   [Navitas Financial Capacity](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/financial-capacity/)\n*   [Navitas Genuine Student](https://www.navitas.com/study/apply/genuine-student/)\n*   [Point Migration English Criteria](https://pointmigrationagency.com.au/understand-the-english-language-criteria-for-australian-visa-applications/)\n*   [Study Australia Visa Application](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/visa-application-process)\n*   [Study Australia English Requirements](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/tools-and-resources/news/english-language-requirements-changes)\n*   [Study Gurus Financial Evidence](https://studygurus.com.au/minimum-financial-evidence-for-your-student-visa-in-australia/)\n*   [Swec Visa Consultant Financial Capacity](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/how-to-prove-financial-capacity-for-an-australian-student-visa/)\n*   [Vishico Streamlined Regular](https://vishico.com/streamlined-and-regular/)"

      "full_response": "## DHA's Consideration of Evidentiary Requirements for Student Visas: A Statistical and Compliance-Based Approach\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) in Australia employs a risk-based framework to assess student visa applications. This framework aims to streamline the visa process for genuine students while safeguarding the integrity of Australia's immigration system. A key component of this assessment involves considering evidentiary requirements for students from different countries. Based on available information, the DHA primarily determines these requirements based on **statistical evidence of how students from that country comply with their visa conditions based on previous students\u2019 behavior in the last 12 months**. This report will delve into the specifics of this approach, examining the factors considered, the framework employed, and the implications for student visa applicants.\n\n### The Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF) and Evidence Levels\n\nThe DHA utilizes the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF), implemented on July 1, 2016, to guide the evidentiary requirements for student visa applications ([b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b2-australian-international-education-an-overview/topic/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958)). The SSVF operates on a combination of the student's country of citizenship and the rating of the education provider where the student intends to undertake their principal course of study ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). This combined rating determines whether a student is subject to streamlined (S) or regular (R) evidentiary requirements ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n\nStudents subject to regular evidentiary requirements are generally required to provide evidence of their financial capacity and English language proficiency with their visa application ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). Those eligible for streamlined arrangements may satisfy the DHA of their financial capacity through a declaration and are not generally required to provide evidence of their English language proficiency ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). However, the DHA retains the discretion to request further evidence from any student, regardless of their eligibility for streamlined arrangements ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n\n### Factors Influencing Evidence Level Ratings\n\nThe DHA updates the country and provider ratings every six months based on historical data generated during the previous 12-month period ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). These ratings are calculated using a weighted average of several indicators related to student immigration outcomes ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). Key indicators include:\n\n*   **Rate of visa cancellations (25% weighting):** This measures the proportion of student visas cancelled due to non-genuineness, fraud, or breaches of visa condition 8202 (maintaining enrolment, attendance, and course progress) ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). Breaches of work condition 8105 (working more than 40 hours per fortnight when the course is in session) and other visa conditions are also considered ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n*   **Rate of refusals due to a fraud reason (40% weighting):** This represents the proportion of student visas refused at the application stage due to fraud ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). If a visa is refused due to fraud, this measure applies regardless of any other refusal reason ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n*   **Rate of refusals (excluding fraud) where the applicant lodged overseas (10% weighting):** This measures the proportion of student visas refused for reasons other than fraud, such as not meeting the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) (now Genuine Student (GS)), health, or other requirements ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n*   **Rate of student visa holders becoming unlawful non-citizens (15% weighting):** This refers to the number of students who have overstayed their student visa for more than 28 days ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). Students who resolve their immigration status within 28 days are not counted ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n*   **Rate of Subsequent Protection Visa applications (10% weighting):** This represents the proportion of students who applied for a Protection Visa (PV) where their last visa was a Student visa ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)).\n\nThese indicators provide a comprehensive overview of a country's or provider's compliance with student visa regulations. Higher rates of visa cancellations, fraud, refusals, unlawful non-citizens, and protection visa applications contribute to a higher evidence level rating, potentially leading to more stringent evidentiary requirements for future student visa applicants from that country or provider.\n\n### Evidence Level Ratings and Streamlined Processing\n\nThe DHA assigns evidence level ratings to both education providers and countries based on the weighted average of the aforementioned indicators ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). The ratings are categorized as follows:\n\n*   **Evidence Level One:** Below 1.0 index (weighted average).\n*   **Evidence Level Two:** Between 1.0 and 2.70 index.\n*   **Evidence Level Three:** Above 2.70 index.\n\nThe combination of the student's country rating and the provider rating determines whether the student is eligible for streamlined evidentiary requirements ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing)). Generally, students from countries and attending providers with lower evidence levels are more likely to be eligible for streamlined processing, requiring less documentation upfront.\n\n### The Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nThe Genuine Temporary Entry (GTE) requirement, previously a key measure in determining visa eligibility, was replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement on March 23, 2024 ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)). This change aimed to streamline the application process and enhance immigration integrity. The GS requirement involves answering targeted questions to provide visa decision-makers with clearer insights into applicants' intentions and circumstances ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)). While the GS requirement focuses on the applicant's genuine intention to study, the evidentiary framework and risk-based assessment based on country and provider ratings remain crucial in determining the level of scrutiny applied to the application.\n\n### Financial Capacity and English Language Proficiency\n\nWhile evidence of finances and English proficiency is not always required upfront, the DHA retains the right to request this evidence from any student if there is specific intelligence suggesting a potential issue with their financial capacity ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)). This highlights the importance of being prepared to provide this evidence if requested, even if the student is initially assessed as eligible for streamlined processing.\n\nTo demonstrate financial capacity, students can provide evidence of:\n\n*   Money deposit with a financial institution (bank).\n*   Loan with a financial institution (bank).\n*   Government loans.\n*   Scholarship ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)).\n\nThere are three options to provide financial evidence ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)):\n\n1.  **12 months living expenses:** Evidence of funds for travel costs plus 12 months of living and tuition costs. As of 2024, the minimum funds required are AUD$29,710 for a single student, AUD$10,394 for a spouse or de-facto partner, and AUD$4,449 per dependent child ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)).\n2.  **Annual income of parents:** Evidence that the annual income of the student\u2019s parents (combined if necessary) or spouse exceeds AUD$87,856 per year. If one or more members of the applicant\u2019s family unit are seeking to satisfy the secondary criteria, they will need to demonstrate an income of AUD$102,500 per year ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)).\n3.  **Secondary exchange students only:** A completed Acceptable Advice for Secondary Exchange Student (AASES) Form ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements)).\n\n### Integrity Concerns and Visa Refusals\n\nThe DHA identifies several integrity concerns that can lead to student visa refusals ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)). These include:\n\n*   **English language skills:** Providing fraudulent English test results or lacking the necessary English proficiency ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)).\n*   **Genuine student/temporary entrant:** Failing to demonstrate a genuine intention to study and a realistic prospect of returning home after completing studies ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)).\n*   **Family background and financial support:** Providing false information about family income or lacking sufficient funds to support studies in Australia ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)).\n*   **Document fraud:** Submitting fraudulent documents to support the visa application ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)).\n\nThese examples highlight the importance of providing accurate and genuine information in the visa application. The DHA conducts integrity checks and may request interviews to verify the information provided ([b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the DHA considers evidentiary requirements for students from different countries primarily based on statistical evidence of how students from that country comply with their visa conditions. This risk-based approach, implemented through the SSVF, aims to streamline the visa process for genuine students while mitigating immigration risks. The DHA uses a weighted average of several indicators, including visa cancellations, fraud rates, refusal rates, unlawful non-citizen rates, and protection visa application rates, to determine the evidence level rating for each country and provider. While the GS requirement focuses on the applicant's genuine intention to study, the evidentiary framework remains crucial in determining the level of scrutiny applied to the application. Students should be aware of these requirements and prepared to provide accurate and genuine information to support their visa application.\n\n### References\n\n*   b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md.

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the student's query, adhering to the specified guidelines:### Report: International Student's Eligibility for Part-Time Study in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\nThis report addresses the scenario of an international student enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering program in Australia on a Student Visa (subclass 500) who wishes to change from full-time to part-time study. It examines the relevant regulations, policies, and potential implications under the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code) and other relevant legislative frameworks.\n\n**Overview of Student Visa Requirements**\nTo study in Australia, international students typically need to obtain a student visa (subclass 500) ([The University of Western Australia, 2024](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/international-students/moving-to-perth/student-visas)). This visa has specific conditions that students must adhere to throughout their stay. One of the primary conditions is maintaining enrollment in a full-time registered course ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](None)).\n\n**Full-Time Study Load Requirements**\nA standard full-time study load at Australian universities typically involves enrolling in a specified number of credit points per semester or academic year. For instance, at the University of Western Australia, a full-time load is 24 credit points per semester or 48 credit points per academic year ([The University of Western Australia, 2024](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/international-students/moving-to-perth/student-visas)). Similarly, at UNSW Sydney, international students are generally required to enroll in 48 units of credit (UOC) per year, with at least 12 UOC per term ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)). At the University of Melbourne, full-time enrollment requires at least 37.5 points (3 standard subjects) per half-year period, though student visa holders are typically required to enroll in 50 points each half-year period ([University of Melbourne, n.d.](https://ask.unimelb.edu.au/faq/1018/)).\n\n**The National Code of Practice 2018**\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code) sets nationally consistent standards for education providers to deliver quality education and training to overseas students ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)). It is a legislative instrument under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act) ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)). Compliance with the National Code is mandatory for education providers to maintain their registration to provide education services to international students ([Department of Education, Australian Government, n.d.a](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)).\n\n**Visa Condition 8202: Maintaining Enrolment**\nVisa condition 8202 mandates that students must maintain enrollment in a full-time registered course at the same or higher Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level as the course for which the visa was granted ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](None)). Transferring to a lower AQF level course or a non-AQF award course is a breach of the student visa condition and may result in visa cancellation ([B1-overview.md](None)).\n\n**Possibility of Reducing Study Load**\nWhile full-time study is generally required, there are specific circumstances under which an international student may be allowed to reduce their study load. Universities may approve a reduced study load if the student can demonstrate specific compassionate or compelling reasons ([The University of Sydney, n.d.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/reduced-study-load.html)).\n\n**Compassionate or Compelling Circumstances**\nCompassionate or compelling circumstances typically involve situations that are beyond the student's control and have a significant impact on their ability to study full-time. Examples include:\n*   Serious illness or injury ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n*   Death of a close family member ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n*   Political upheaval or natural disaster in the student's home country ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](None)).\n*   Significant emotional or psychological difficulties ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n\n**University Approval Process**\nTo reduce their study load, the student must apply to their university, providing documented evidence of the compassionate or compelling circumstances ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)). The university will assess the application based on its policies and procedures. If approved, the university will notify the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) of the reduced study load ([C3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md](None)).\n\n**Implications for the Student Visa**\nReducing the study load may have implications for the student visa. The National Code requires international student visa holders to complete their program within the time specified on their Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)). If reducing the study load lengthens the time it takes to complete the program, the student may need to extend their CoE and student visa ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)). There will be additional costs associated with extending the student visa, such as administration fees, overseas student health cover, and medical assessment ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n\n**Potential Visa Cancellation**\nIf the student fails to maintain satisfactory course progress or does not comply with their visa conditions, their visa may be cancelled ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](None)). Breaching visa conditions can also result in a three-year ban (exclusion period) on re-entry to Australia ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](None)).\n\n**Recent Changes to Student Visa Regulations**\nIn 2025, Australia has introduced stricter guidelines for student visa applicants to ensure they are genuine students ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). These changes include:\n*   Capping international student enrollments at 270,000 to address resource allocation and housing shortages ([Pandey, 2025](https://www.moneycontrol.com/education/australia-student-visa-2025-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-visa-rules-and-updated-student-policies-article-12908700.html)).\n*   Stricter adherence to Confirmation of Enrollment (CoE) requirements to enhance academic integrity and transparency ([Pandey, 2025](https://www.moneycontrol.com/education/australia-student-visa-2025-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-visa-rules-and-updated-student-policies-article-12908700.html)).\n*   Revised financial proof requirements to ensure students can cover tuition fees, living costs, and accommodation expenses ([Pandey, 2025](https://www.moneycontrol.com/education/australia-student-visa-2025-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-visa-rules-and-updated-student-policies-article-12908700.html)).\n*   Limiting work hours for international students to 48 per fortnight to balance academic focus and financial independence ([Pandey, 2025](https://www.moneycontrol.com/education/australia-student-visa-2025-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-visa-rules-and-updated-student-policies-article-12908700.html)).\n*   Restricting onshore applications for student visas from temporary visa holders unless they meet all requirements, including holding a CoE ([VisaVerge.com, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n**Advice for the Student**\nBased on the information available, the student should:\n1.  **Consult with the University:** The student should immediately consult with their university's international student support services or academic advisors to discuss their difficulties and explore options for reducing their study load ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n2.  **Gather Evidence:** The student should gather documented evidence of the reasons they are finding the program difficult. This may include medical certificates, counseling reports, or other relevant documents ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n3.  **Apply for Reduced Study Load:** If the university advises that the student's circumstances meet the criteria for compassionate or compelling reasons, the student should formally apply for a reduced study load, following the university's procedures ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n4.  **Understand the Implications:** The student should fully understand the implications of reducing their study load, including the potential need to extend their CoE and student visa, and the associated costs ([UNSW Sydney, n.d.](https://www.unsw.edu.au/student/managing-your-studies/essentials/visa-requirements/change-your-study-situation/reducing-your-study-load)).\n5.  **Maintain Compliance:** The student must continue to comply with all other visa conditions, such as maintaining adequate health insurance and informing the university of their current address ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](None)).\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile the National Code generally requires international students to study full-time, it does allow for reduced study loads in specific, documented compassionate or compelling circumstances. The decision to approve a reduced study load rests with the university, and the student must follow the university's procedures and provide sufficient evidence to support their request. The student should be aware of the potential implications for their student visa and take steps to maintain compliance with all visa conditions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the student may be able to study part-time if the university approves their reduced study load request based on compelling circumstances.**References**\n\n*   B1-overview.md.

Given the student's status as a student visa holder, the educational institution has specific obligations and procedures to follow. This report will outline the appropriate steps the institution should take, emphasizing compliance with Australian regulations and ethical responsibilities. The analysis considers relevant information from provided documents and external web sources to provide a comprehensive recommendation.\n\n**Scenario Overview**\n\nAn education agent has recruited a student to enroll in a Foundation Year Program in Australia. The student is on a student visa but has been absent from classes for two weeks. The central question is: What action should the institution take?\n\n**Analysis of Available Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided:\n\n1.  **Let the student do what they want as they are in Australia and away from their parents:** This option is unacceptable. Educational institutions have a duty of care towards their students, particularly international students on visas. Ignoring attendance issues would violate visa conditions and institutional responsibilities ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n2.  **Send an email to all agents telling them that the student you recruited is a very bad one:** This option is unprofessional and potentially defamatory. It does not address the core issue of the student's non-attendance and could damage the institution's relationship with its agents ([d2-2-professional-standards.md](d2-2-professional-standards.md)).\n\n3.  **Contact you immediately and ask for help in locating the student:** While involving the agent might be a part of the process, it should not be the immediate or sole action. The institution has primary responsibility for student welfare and visa compliance ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md)).\n\n4.  **Report the student without seeking to find out where the student is:** This option is premature. Reporting the student to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) should be a last resort, taken after reasonable attempts to contact the student and address the attendance issue ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Recommended Institutional Response**\n\nBased on the provided information and current regulations, the institution should follow a structured approach:\n\n1.  **Initial Contact and Investigation:**\n    *   The institution should attempt to contact the student through all available channels (email, phone, etc.) to inquire about the reason for their absence.\n    *   Check the student's provided emergency contact information and attempt to reach out to them to gather more information ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n    *   Review the student's attendance record and academic progress to identify any patterns or underlying issues.\n\n2.  **Formal Notification and Counseling:**\n    *   If initial contact attempts are unsuccessful or the student's explanation is unsatisfactory, the institution should issue a formal written notification to the student. This notification should:\n        *   Clearly state the attendance requirements and the consequences of non-compliance.\n        *   Offer the student an opportunity to explain their absence and provide supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificate).\n        *   Inform the student of available support services, such as counseling, academic advising, and health services ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md), [overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n    *   Provide a timeline for the student to respond and rectify the situation.\n\n3.  **Intervention and Support:**\n    *   Offer the student a meeting with an international student advisor or counselor to discuss their situation and develop a plan for improvement ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md)).\n    *   Explore potential reasons for the student's absence, such as:\n        *   Academic difficulties: Offer tutoring or learning support services ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md), [overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n        *   Personal or health issues: Refer the student to appropriate counseling or health services ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md), [overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n        *   Cultural adjustment problems: Provide cultural awareness workshops or peer support programs ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md), [overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n        *   Financial difficulties: Offer information on financial aid or support services ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md), [overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n\n4.  **Compliance with Visa Condition 8202:**\n    *   Ensure the student is aware of Visa Condition 8202, which requires them to maintain satisfactory attendance and course progress ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Document all communication and interventions with the student.\n\n5.  **Reporting to DHA (Department of Home Affairs):**\n    *   If the student fails to respond to the formal notification, does not provide a satisfactory explanation, or does not improve their attendance after intervention, the institution must consider reporting the student to DHA via PRISMS (Provider Registration and International Student Management System) ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Before reporting, ensure that the institution has followed its documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and attendance ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Issue a written notification of the intention to report the student to DHA, informing the student of their right to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process within 20 working days ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Only report the student after the timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalized in favor of the provider ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n6.  **Agent Involvement (Cautious Approach):**\n    *   Once the institution has made reasonable attempts to contact the student and has followed its internal procedures, it may be appropriate to contact the education agent.\n    *   The agent may have additional contact information or insights into the student's situation.\n    *   However, maintain student privacy and only share information that is necessary and compliant with privacy laws ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md)).\n\n**Legal and Regulatory Context**\n\n*   **National Code 2018:** Standard 8 of the National Code emphasizes the need for registered providers to safeguard the integrity of Australia\u2019s migration laws by supporting overseas students to complete their course and fulfill their visa requirements ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)).\n*   **ESOS Act:** The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 sets out the legal framework for the regulation of education providers offering courses to overseas students ([d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md](d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md)).\n*   **Visa Condition 8202:** This condition mandates that students maintain enrolment in a registered course, satisfy attendance requirements, and make satisfactory course progress ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **PRISMS:** The Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) is the database used by education providers to report information about international students to DHA ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Impact of 2025 Visa Rule Updates**\n\nSeveral updates to the student visa rules in 2025 further emphasize the need for institutions to monitor and report student attendance and progress:\n\n*   **Genuine Student Requirement (GS):** Replacing the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement, the GS assesses the applicant\u2019s intention to study in Australia, making it crucial for institutions to ensure students are genuinely engaged in their studies ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is mandatory for all visa applications, reinforcing the importance of institutions verifying and maintaining accurate enrolment records ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Attendance Monitoring:** Strict attendance monitoring is required, with institutions expected to report attendance every study period and issue warnings at 90% and 85% attendance levels ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). Visa cancellation may occur if attendance falls below 80%.\n*   **Work Rights:** Limited work rights during term time (up to 48 hours per fortnight) emphasize the primary purpose of the student's stay is study, reinforcing the need for institutions to monitor academic engagement ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nFailure to comply with reporting requirements can have severe consequences for the institution, including:\n\n*   **Fines:** Institutions may be fined for failing to report student breaches of visa conditions ([cpdimmigration.com](https://cpdimmigration.com/explained-reporting-international-student-no-shows-in-the-big-four/)).\n*   **Suspension:** The institution's ability to enroll international students may be suspended ([cpdimmigration.com](https://cpdimmigration.com/explained-reporting-international-student-no-shows-in-the-big-four/)).\n*   **Revocation of Registration:** The institution's registration as a provider of education services to overseas students may be revoked ([cpdimmigration.com](https://cpdimmigration.com/explained-reporting-international-student-no-shows-in-the-big-four/)).\n\n**Support Services for International Students**\n\nInstitutions should ensure that international students are aware of and have access to a range of support services, including:\n\n*   **Academic Support:** Learning and teaching centers, peer-assisted study sessions, online learning resources, and academic skills advisors ([overseasstudentsaustralia.com](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/support-services-for-international-students-in-australia/)).\n*   **Counseling and Mental Health Services:** Support for relationships, crisis intervention, mental health, and suicide prevention ([ozstudies.com](https://www.ozstudies.com/studying-in-australia/why-study-in-australia/support-services-for-international-students)).\n*   **International Student Advisors:** Providing advice on settling into accommodation, cultural adjustment, academic progress, and visa compliance ([c4-2-people.md](c4-2-people.md)).\n*   **Accommodation Officers:** Assisting in securing accommodation for newly arrived students ([c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md](c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the case of a student visa holder with poor attendance, the institution must act responsibly and in accordance with Australian regulations. The recommended approach involves initial contact and investigation, formal notification and counseling, intervention and support, compliance with visa conditions, and, as a last resort, reporting to DHA. Involving the agent should be done cautiously and with consideration for student privacy. By following these steps, the institution can fulfill its duty of care, maintain its compliance obligations, and support the student in achieving their academic goals.\n\n**References**\n\n*   a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md\n*   a7-5-international-student-numbers.md\n*   a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md\n*   b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md\n*   b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md\n*   b4-1-national-code-standards.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md*   b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md\n*   c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md\n*   c2-5-roles-international-relations-development-executive-positions.md\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   c3-3-after-completing-course.md\n*   c3-student-client-management.md\n*   c4-2-people.md\n*   c4-3-programs.md\n*   c5-6-student-support-services.md\n*   d2-2-professional-standards.md\n*   d3-6-student-management.md\n*   d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md\n*   [Acic.

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Requirements for Under-18 Students in Australia: A Comprehensive Report\n\nThe Australian Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has specific requirements for international students under the age of 18 who wish to study in Australia. These requirements are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of these students, as they are considered minors under Australian law ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). One of the key aspects of these requirements is related to accommodation and welfare arrangements. This report will analyze the accommodation options available to a 17-year-old student seeking to study in Australia, based on the provided information.\n\n**The Correct Accommodation Option**\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is: Live with a relative over 21, their parent or guardian or in accommodation approved by the education provider.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe Australian government mandates that international students under 18 years of age must have adequate welfare arrangements in place for the duration of their visa or until they turn 18 ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). These arrangements can take one of the following forms:\n\n1.  **Living with a Parent or Legal Custodian:** The student can live in Australia with a parent or legal custodian who holds a valid visa that allows them to remain in Australia until the student turns 18 ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/), [Student.unsw.edu.au](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/parents-or-custodians-under-18-years-students)). The parent or legal custodian may need to apply for a Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) ([B1-overview.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b1-overview/), [B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958/)).\n\n2.  **Living with a Relative:** The student can live with a relative who meets specific criteria. The relative must:\n\n    *   Be a brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, step-grandparent, step-aunt, step-uncle, step-niece, or step-nephew ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n    *   Be aged over 21 years ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/), [Insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/international-students-under-18-australia-accommodation/)).\n    *   Have the right to remain in Australia until the visa expires or the student turns 18, whichever happens first ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n    *   Have a police clearance check ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n\n3.  **Education Provider Approved Accommodation:** If the student is not living with a parent, legal custodian, or suitable relative, the education provider must provide for their general welfare and accommodation ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). The provider will issue a Confirmation of Adequate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW) letter ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n\n**Why the Other Options are Incorrect**\n\n*   **Live with a relative over 18, their parent or guardian or in accommodation approved by the education provider:** This is incorrect because relatives must be over 21 years of age to be considered suitable guardians ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n*   **Live with a person over 21 years of age who has no criminal records or in accommodation approved by the education provider:** This is incorrect because the person must be a relative, parent, or legal custodian. While having no criminal record is a requirement for relatives, it is not sufficient on its own ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n*   **Live where ever and with whomever they would like as the student is almost 18 and is living away from their home country:** This is incorrect because students under 18 are legally considered minors and require approved welfare arrangements ([Insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/international-students-under-18-australia-accommodation/)).\n\n**Further Considerations for Under-18 Students**\n\n*   **Form 1229:** The student's parents or custodian must complete Form 1229 \u2013 Consent to grant an Australian visa to a child under the age of 18 years ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/), [Immi.homeaffairs.gov.au](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/welfare-arrangements-students-under-18)).\n*   **CAAW Letter:** If the education provider is responsible for the student's welfare, the CAAW letter must nominate two dates: when the provider begins taking responsibility and when they cease to take responsibility ([B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). The minimum period on the CAAW letter must be the same as the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) plus 7 days or until the student turns 18 ([Immi.homeaffairs.gov.au](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/welfare-arrangements-students-under-18)).\n*   **Changing Welfare Arrangements:** Students cannot change their welfare arrangements without written approval from their education provider ([Immi.homeaffairs.gov.au](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/welfare-arrangements-students-under-18)).\n*   **Temporary Absences:** Students are required to reside at the address of their approved accommodation provider at all times and cannot stay overnight at any other address without prior approval from the University of Sydney ([Sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/study/applying/apply-for-a-visa/under-18-international-student-visa-holder.html)).\n*   **Financial Capacity:** All applicants for a Student Guardian visa must have sufficient funds to support themselves, the nominating student(s), and any secondary applicants for the duration of their intended stay in Australia ([B8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/)). Evidence of financial capacity can be provided through evidence of annual income of $70,000 or more, or evidence of sufficient funds to cover travel costs and the first 12 months of living costs ([B8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/)).\n\n**Accommodation Options Approved by Education Providers**\n\nIf the student's education provider is responsible for their accommodation and welfare, several options are available:\n\n*   **Homestay:** This involves living with an Australian family in their home ([A4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options/), [C3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia/), [C5-7-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-7-accommodation-options/), [Studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/life-in-australia/accommodation)). Homestay is popular with younger students and those studying short-term English courses ([A4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options/), [C5-7-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-7-accommodation-options/)). Meals are usually included in the cost, and single or shared rooms may be offered ([A4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options/)). Education providers must ensure that homestay families are reputable and offer good accommodation ([A4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options/), [C5-7-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-7-accommodation-options/)). Several organizations can assist with homestay arrangements, including Australian Homestay Network, Global Experience, and Homestay Australia ([Neas.org.au](https://neas.org.au/homestay/), [Studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/life-in-australia/accommodation)).\n*   **Managed Student Accommodation:** These are purpose-built buildings that are well-located and offer various room options, from solo studio apartments to multi-bedroom duplexes ([Insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/international-students-under-18-australia-accommodation/)).\n*   **Boarding Schools:** Many private secondary schools provide accommodation, meals, and laundry services for international students ([C5-7-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-7-accommodation-options/)).\n*   **University Apartments, Colleges, and Halls of Residence:** These options are also available, but the cost can vary ([C5-7-accommodation-options.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-7-accommodation-options/)).\n\n**Obligations of Education Providers**\n\nRegistered providers of overseas students aged under 18 must meet legislative or other regulatory requirements relating to child welfare and protection ([B4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)). They must provide students with emergency contact information and information about how to report actual or alleged abuse ([B4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)). Where the registered provider has taken on responsibility for the approval of welfare arrangements, they must ensure the arrangements are suitable, ongoing, and appropriately managed until the student turns 18 ([B4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/)).\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nIt is essential that students comply with their visa conditions. If a student does not comply, their visa may be cancelled, and they may need to return home ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/)). There is also a three-year ban (exclusion period) on re-entry to Australia if a visa is cancelled for breaching visa conditions ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, a 17-year-old student wishing to study in Australia must live with a parent or legal custodian, a relative over 21 who meets the specified criteria, or in accommodation approved by their education provider. The Australian government has strict requirements in place to ensure the safety and well-being of international students under 18, and it is crucial that students and their families understand and comply with these requirements. Failure to do so can result in visa cancellation and a ban on re-entry to Australia.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n*   A4-4-entry-points-typical-costs-and-accommodation-options.md*   B1-overview.md\n*   B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md\n*   B4-1-national-code-standards.md\n*   B7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md*   B8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md\n*   B8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md\n*   B9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   C3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   C5-7-accommodation-options.md\n*   [Immi.homeaffairs.gov.au](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/welfare-arrangements-students-under-18)\n*   [Insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/international-students-under-18-australia-accommodation/)\n*   [Neas.org.au](https://neas.org.au/homestay/)\n*   [Student.unsw.edu.au](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/parents-or-custodians-under-18-years-students)\n*   [Studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en_in/life-in-australia/accommodation)\n*   [Sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/study/applying/apply-for-a-visa/under-18-international-student-visa-holder.html)"

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Conditions and the AQF: A Comprehensive Report\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Australian student visa program is designed to facilitate international students pursuing education within the country. However, obtaining a visa is only the first step. Maintaining compliance with visa conditions is crucial for the duration of their stay. This report aims to clarify the specific requirements for students who have been granted a student visa under streamlined arrangements, particularly concerning course levels within the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). The central question addressed is whether a student who gained a student visa under streamlined arrangements must remain in an AQF course of the same or higher level, or if they may need to apply for a new student visa. This report will delve into the relevant regulations, conditions, and potential implications for international students.\n\n### Overview of Student Visa Requirements\n\nTo understand the obligations of students under streamlined arrangements, it is essential to first outline the general requirements for obtaining and maintaining a student visa. The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) mandates several criteria that applicants must meet, including acceptance into a full-time study program, demonstrating genuine temporary entrant status, fulfilling health and health insurance requirements, possessing good character, and having no debts to the Australian Government ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)).\n\nIn addition to these basic requirements, students must also demonstrate appropriate English language skills and, if under 18, have acceptable arrangements for accommodation and welfare ([b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)). These criteria ensure that students are well-prepared for their studies and can contribute positively to the Australian educational environment.\n\n### Health Insurance Requirements\n\nOne of the critical conditions for student visa holders is maintaining adequate health insurance. The DHA requires evidence of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) to ensure that students are adequately insured throughout their stay ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)). OSHC provides access to medical and hospital services, offering peace of mind and necessary coverage for healthcare needs ([unicreds.com](https://unicreds.com/blog/student-health-insurance-australia/)).\n\nStudents (and any accompanying family members) must have OSHC for the entire duration of their student visa, from the date of arrival in Australia to the visa's expiry date ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)). Failure to maintain health insurance can result in visa cancellation ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-1-visa-conditions/)).\n\n### The Significance of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF)\n\nThe Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) is a national framework that defines educational qualifications across various levels, from Certificate I to Doctoral Degree ([b1-overview.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b1-overview.md)). The AQF ensures consistency and comparability of qualifications across different institutions and sectors. For student visa holders, maintaining enrolment at the same or a higher AQF level is a critical visa condition ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\n### Visa Condition 8202 and Course Level Maintenance\n\nVisa condition 8202 explicitly states that students must maintain enrolment in a full-time registered course that provides a qualification at the same or higher level than the course for which the visa was granted ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-1-visa-conditions/)). This condition is strictly enforced to ensure that students are genuinely pursuing educational goals and not using the student visa as a means to circumvent immigration laws.\n\nTransferring to a lower AQF level course or from an AQF level course to a non-AQF award course is a breach of the student visa condition and might result in visa cancellation ([b1-overview.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b1-overview.md)). The DHA closely monitors students who change their course soon after arrival, make large changes in level (e.g., Bachelor to Certificate III), or switch to very different course types ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\n### Exceptions to the AQF Level Requirement\n\nThere is one specific exception to the requirement of maintaining the same or higher AQF level. Students undertaking a doctoral degree (AQF 10) may transfer to a master\u2019s degree (AQF 9) without breaching their visa conditions ([b1-overview.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b1-overview.md)). This exception recognizes the flexibility that doctoral students may need in their academic pursuits.\n\n### Changing Courses and Institutions\n\nIf a student wants to change courses within the same institution but at the same AQF level, a new student visa is not required ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)). However, if the new course is longer than the original, the student must apply for a further student visa before their current visa expires.\n\nIf a student wishes to undertake a shorter course than that for which the visa was granted, they must either depart Australia within 28 days of completing the shorter course or notify DHA and apply for a new student visa if they wish to enrol in a further course of study ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\n### Streamlined Visa Processing (SVP) and its Implications\n\nThe Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF) came into effect on 1 July 2016, streamlining the application process for international students ([b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958/)). Under SSVF, international students apply for a single Student visa (subclass 500) regardless of their chosen course of study. The evidentiary requirements are determined by a combination of the student\u2019s country of citizenship and the rating of the education provider ([b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)).\n\nHowever, the Streamlined Visa Processing (SVP) regime has also led to some emerging issues. Some students and agents have been found to exploit the system by gaining student visas with no genuine intention of studying at the nominated institution. These students withdraw immediately upon arrival and transfer to cheaper institutions, often in different sectors ([d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice/)).\n\nTo combat this, the DHA closely monitors changes in course and institution, particularly those that occur soon after arrival ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)).\n\n### Genuine Student (GS) Requirement\n\nAs of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Student (GS) requirement replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement for student visas ([kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/), [soledu.net](https://www.soledu.net/au/blog/genuine-student-requirement-explained/)). The GS requirement focuses on demonstrating a true interest and commitment to studying in Australia, rather than just temporary residency ([soledu.net](https://www.soledu.net/au/blog/genuine-student-requirement-explained/)).\n\nThe application now asks specific questions about the applicant's background, reasons for choosing Australia and the specific course, and future focus ([soledu.net](https://www.soledu.net/au/blog/genuine-student-requirement-explained/)). This ensures that students are genuinely motivated to pursue their studies and contribute to Australia's educational environment.\n\n### Updated Visa Rules for 2025\n\nSeveral updates to the student visa rules have been implemented in 2025 to strengthen the integrity of the international education sector ([provinceimmigration.com](https://provinceimmigration.com/blogs/updated-prioritisation-rules-for-australian-student-visas), [visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). These include requiring a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) at the time of application, increased financial requirements, updated English language proficiency standards, and stricter GS criteria ([avie.com.au](https://avie.com.au/student-visa-changes-2025/), [swecvisaconsultant.com](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/understanding-the-australian-student-visa-subclass-500/)).\n\nA cap of 270,000 new international student commencements has also been introduced for 2025 to manage the growing number of international students ([a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-5-international-student-numbers/), [visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). This cap aims to balance the expansion of Australia\u2019s education sector with infrastructure and economic sustainability.\n\n### Permanent Residency Pathways\n\nWhile the primary intention of a student visa is to facilitate study, many international students aspire to gain permanent residency (PR) in Australia after completing their studies ([ivc-services.com](https://ivc-services.com/blog/permanent-residency-in-australia-with-student-visa), [visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/applying-for-permanent-residency-in-australia-on-a-student-visa-is-it-possible/)). Several pathways are available, including the Post-Study Work visa, Skilled Migration, Partner Visa, and Employer Nomination Scheme ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/applying-for-permanent-residency-in-australia-on-a-student-visa-is-it-possible/)).\n\nThe Post-Study Work stream of the Temporary Graduate visa (subclass 485) offers extended options for working in Australia to eligible graduates of a higher education degree ([c5-8-ability-to-work.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c5-8-ability-to-work/)). Successful applicants are granted a visa of two, three, or four years duration, depending on the highest educational qualification they have obtained ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information presented, it is evident that a student who gained a student visa under streamlined arrangements **must remain in an AQF course of the same or higher level or they may need to apply for a new student visa**. Visa condition 8202 explicitly requires students to maintain enrolment at the same or higher AQF level, with limited exceptions. Failure to comply with this condition can lead to visa cancellation. The DHA closely monitors changes in course and institution, and the introduction of the Genuine Student (GS) requirement further reinforces the need for students to demonstrate a genuine commitment to their studies. While pathways to permanent residency exist, maintaining compliance with visa conditions is paramount for international students in Australia.\n\n### References\n\n*   [a7-5-international-student-numbers.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-5-international-student-numbers/)\n*   [avie.com.au](https://avie.com.au/student-visa-changes-2025/)\n*   [b1-overview.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b1-overview.md)\n*   [b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958/)\n*   [b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)\n*   [b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)\n*   [b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)\n*   [b9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-1-visa-conditions/)\n*   [b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/)\n*   [b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)\n*   [c5-8-ability-to-work.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c5-8-ability-to-work/)\n*   [d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice/)\n*   [kangarooedu.au](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)\n*   [provinceimmigration.com](https://provinceimmigration.com/blogs/updated-prioritisation-rules-for-australian-student-visas)\n*   [soledu.net](https://www.soledu.net/au/blog/genuine-student-requirement-explained/)\n*   [swecvisaconsultant.com](https://swecvisaconsultant.com/understanding-the-australian-student-visa-subclass-500/)\n*   [unicreds.com](https://unicreds.com/blog/student-health-insurance-australia/)\n*   [visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)\n*   [visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/applying-for-permanent-residency-in-australia-on-a-student-visa-is-it-possible/)"

      "full_response": "## Understanding Visa Condition 8201 for Australian Tourist Visas: A Detailed Report\n\nA prospective student planning a two-month visit to relatives in Australia is considering studying English while there. Her tourist visa includes condition 8201. This report aims to clarify the implications of this visa condition, providing a comprehensive understanding of its restrictions and available options.\n\n**The Correct Interpretation of Visa Condition 8201**\n\nBased on the provided information, the correct interpretation of visa condition 8201 is: **She is not able to engage in any study or training for more than three months**. This condition, commonly attached to visitor visas, explicitly limits the duration of study or training an individual can undertake while in Australia ([Korrylink Migration Consultants, n.d.](https://korrylink.com.au/tourist-visas/visitor-visa-conditions-and-waiver/); [Visitor-visa, 2024](https://www.visitor-visa.com.au/australian-tourist-visa-conditions/); [Visa Plan Lawyers, n.d.](https://visaplan.au/visitor-visa/tourist/)).\n\n**In-Depth Analysis of Visa Condition 8201**Visa condition 8201 is a standard clause imposed on visitor visas (subclass 600) granted by the Australian Department of Home Affairs (DHA) ([Visitor-visa, 2024](https://www.visitor-visa.com.au/australian-tourist-visa-conditions/)). It directly addresses the extent to which individuals on tourist visas can participate in educational activities. The primary intention of a tourist visa is for tourism and recreational purposes, with any study undertaken being secondary to this main objective ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Permissible Study on a Tourist Visa**\n\nThe three-month limit allows visitors to engage in short courses or training programs that enhance their travel experience without shifting the visa's fundamental purpose ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)). Examples of permissible activities include:\n\n*   **Short language courses:** A 10-week English Intensive Language Course for Overseas Students (ELICOS) is a common example ([Study Australia, n.d.](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/other-types-of-visas)).\n*   **Recreational courses:** Cooking classes, photography workshops, or other short-term workshops are generally acceptable ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Restrictions and Limitations**\n\nWhile some study is allowed, it's crucial to understand the limitations imposed by condition 8201:\n\n*   **Duration:** The total duration of any study or training must not exceed three months ([Korrylink Migration Consultants, n.d.](https://korrylink.com.au/tourist-visas/visitor-visa-conditions-and-waiver/); [Visitor-visa, 2024](https://www.visitor-visa.com.au/australian-tourist-visa-conditions/); [Visa Plan Lawyers, n.d.](https://visaplan.au/visitor-visa/tourist/)).\n*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the visit must remain tourism. Study should be a secondary activity ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   **Visa type:** The tourist visa is not intended for long-term study. Individuals planning to pursue a degree or longer course must apply for a student visa (subclass 500) ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nBreaching visa conditions, including condition 8201, can have severe consequences:\n\n*   **Visa cancellation:** The DHA can cancel the visa if the holder fails to comply with any of its conditions ([Crystal Migration, 2023](https://crystalmigration.com.au/2023/01/27/visa-conditions-and-cancellations/)).\n*   **Deportation:** Individuals with cancelled visas may be required to leave Australia ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   **Future visa applications:** Breaching visa conditions can negatively impact future visa applications, potentially leading to refusal or exclusion periods ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Alternative Visa Options for Extended Study**\n\nIf the prospective student intends to study English for longer than three months, she must apply for a student visa (subclass 500) ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)). This visa allows full-time study in Australia and offers additional benefits, such as the ability to work part-time ([Studyau Ikatandinas, n.d.](https://studyau.ikatandinas.com/can-you-study-on-a-tourist-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Key Requirements for a Student Visa (Subclass 500)**\n\nTo obtain a student visa, the applicant must meet several requirements:\n\n*   **Enrollment in a registered course:** The student must enroll in a full-time registered course with a CRICOS-registered provider ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement:** The applicant must demonstrate a genuine intention to stay in Australia temporarily for the purpose of study ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **English language proficiency:** The student must demonstrate adequate English language skills through approved tests like IELTS, TOEFL, or PTE Academic ([B7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)). As of July 1, 2024, a minimum score of 6.0 is required for most applicants ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Financial capacity:** The student must provide evidence of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and health insurance ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Health insurance:** The student must maintain adequate health insurance (Overseas Student Health Cover - OSHC) during their stay in Australia ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Character requirements:** The student must be of good character and not pose a risk to the Australian community ([B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)).\n\n**Recent Changes to Student Visa Regulations (2025)**\n\nSeveral changes to Australian student visa regulations have been implemented in 2025, impacting prospective students:\n\n*   **Certificate of Enrollment (CoE):** Obtaining a CoE from the educational institution is now a critical step in the application process ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Increased application fee:** As of July 1, 2024, the base application fee for student visas increased to AUD $1,600 ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md); [VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Restrictions on onshore applications:** Applying for a student visa from within Australia while holding a temporary visa, such as a visitor visa, has become more restricted. Applicants must meet all requirements, including holding a CoE, to be eligible for an onshore application ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Cap on international student enrollments:** A National Planning Level (NPL) cap of 270,000 new international student commencements has been enforced for 2025 ([Visaandimmigrations, 2025](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\n**Recommendations for the Prospective Student**\n\nGiven the information and the student's intention to potentially study English in Australia, the following recommendations are provided:\n\n1.  **Assess the duration of study:** Determine the length of the English course. If it exceeds three months, a student visa is necessary.\n2.  **If study is less than 3 months:** The student can study while on a tourist visa, but the primary purpose of the visit must remain tourism.\n3.  **If study is longer than 3 months:** Apply for a student visa (subclass 500) well in advance, considering the new CoE requirement and potential processing times.\n4.  **Do not breach visa conditions:** Avoid engaging in unauthorized study, as it can lead to visa cancellation and future immigration issues.\n5.  **Seek professional advice:** Consult with a registered migration agent for personalized guidance on visa options and requirements.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nVisa condition 8201 allows for limited study on a tourist visa, but it's crucial to adhere to the three-month restriction. For extended English studies, a student visa is the appropriate pathway. Understanding the regulations and recent changes is essential for a smooth and compliant educational journey in Australia.\n\n**References**\n\n[B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)[B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)\n\n[B7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md)\n\n[B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)\n\nCrystal Migration.

      "full_response": "## Report on Student Illness and Visa Compliance in Australia\n\nThe following report addresses the scenario of an international student in Australia who has fallen ill and been hospitalized, impacting their ability to attend classes. It provides guidance to an education agent on how to advise the student's parents, considering the student's visa conditions and the policies of Australian educational institutions. The report emphasizes the importance of obtaining medical documentation and communicating with the education provider to ensure compliance with visa requirements.\n\n### Determining the Correct Advice\n\nBased on the provided information, the most appropriate advice to give the parents is:\n\n\"To make sure their son gets a medical certificate from the doctor or hospital so that he can show this to the institution (and DHA if necessary) to prove he has been sick.\"\n\nThis advice is grounded in the following facts and considerations:\n\n*   **Attendance Requirements:** Student visa holders are generally required to maintain satisfactory attendance, often at least 80% of scheduled classes ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md), [https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). While universities may have different attendance policies, a sudden inability to attend classes due to illness needs to be properly documented.\n*   **Visa Condition 8202:** This visa condition mandates that students satisfy their provider's requirements for attendance and course progress ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)). Failure to do so can lead to the education provider reporting the student to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA), potentially resulting in visa cancellation.\n*   **Compassionate and Compelling Circumstances:** Education providers typically have documented policies and procedures for considering compassionate and compelling circumstances that may affect a student's attendance ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)). Serious illness definitely falls under this category.\n*   **Medical Documentation:** Obtaining a medical certificate from a registered health professional is crucial for demonstrating a valid reason for non-attendance ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md)).\n*   **Transparency with the Education Provider:** The student must keep the education provider informed of their current address and any changes in their circumstances ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md), [b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)). This includes informing them of the illness and providing the medical certificate.\n*   **Health Requirements:** The Australian Department of Home Affairs mandates a health check for international students applying for a visa to ensure public health safety within Australia ([https://ivc-services.com/blog/australia-student-visa-health-check](https://ivc-services.com/blog/australia-student-visa-health-check)).\n\n### Why the Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n*   **\"Not to worry, as attendance is not recorded in Australian institutions.\"** This is incorrect and potentially damaging advice. Attendance is generally monitored, especially for courses with mandatory attendance requirements ([https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **\"That he has a big problem as he is not allowed to miss any class for any reason.\"** This is an overstatement. While attendance is important, institutions recognize that students may have legitimate reasons for missing classes, such as illness, and have procedures for addressing these situations ([https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=279](https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=279)).\n\n### Detailed Explanation and Actionable Steps\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** The parents should focus on their son's health and ensure he receives the best possible medical care.\n\n2.  **Medical Certificate:** Obtain a medical certificate from the treating doctor or hospital. The certificate should clearly state:\n\n    *   The student's name and date of birth.\n    *   The dates of hospitalization or the period during which the student is unable to attend classes.\n    *   The nature of the illness (if possible, without breaching patient confidentiality).\n    *   A statement that the illness prevents the student from attending classes.\n    *   The doctor's name, registration number, and contact details.\n\n3.  **Notify the Education Provider:** The student (or the parents, if the student is unable to) should immediately notify the education provider about the illness. This can be done by contacting the student support services, the course coordinator, or the international student advisor. The notification should include:\n\n    *   The student's name and student ID number.\n    *   The course in which the student is enrolled.\n    *   The reason for absence (illness and hospitalization).\n    *   The expected duration of absence.\n    *   A copy of the medical certificate (or advise when it will be provided).\n    *   Contact information for the student and/or parents.\n\n4.  **Understand the Education Provider's Policy:** The education agent should contact their liaison at the student's school to understand the institution's specific policy on attendance and absences due to illness. This will help determine what documentation is required and what steps the student needs to take to ensure compliance.\n\n5.  **Leave of Absence or Suspension of Studies:** Depending on the severity and expected duration of the illness, the student may need to apply for a leave of absence or a suspension of studies. Many universities have specific procedures for international students seeking to suspend their studies due to compassionate or compelling circumstances ([https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=279](https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=279)). The education provider can advise on the appropriate process.\n\n6.  **Impact on Visa:** The education provider is obligated to report any significant changes in the student's enrolment status or attendance to the DHA ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](b4-1-national-code-standards.md)). If the student's absence is prolonged and affects their ability to meet course requirements, the DHA may be notified. However, if the student has provided adequate documentation and is taking steps to address the situation, the impact on their visa should be minimal.\n\n7.  **Health Insurance:** Ensure the student has adequate health insurance (Overseas Student Health Cover - OSHC) ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)). The parents should confirm that the OSHC covers the student's medical expenses.\n\n8.  **Agent's Role:** The education agent should:\n\n    *   Provide accurate information and support to the student and their parents.\n    *   Liaise with the education provider to understand their policies and procedures.\n    *   Advise the student on their options and the potential impact on their visa.\n    *   Respect the student's privacy and confidentiality ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md)).\n\n### Potential Complications and Solutions\n\n*   **Prolonged Illness:** If the student's illness is prolonged and they are unable to resume their studies within a reasonable timeframe, they may need to consider withdrawing from their course and returning home for treatment. In this case, they should seek advice from the education provider and the DHA regarding their visa options.\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** If the DHA is not satisfied with the student's explanation for their absence, they may consider cancelling the visa. In this case, the student has the right to appeal the decision. The education agent can assist the student in finding legal representation if necessary.\n*   **Financial Difficulties:** If the student's illness leads to financial difficulties, the education agent can refer them to student support services or other organizations that provide financial assistance.\n\n### Changes to Student Visa Rules in 2025\n\nIt's important to be aware of the changes to student visa rules in 2025, which aim to ensure genuine applicants and improve the integrity of the visa system ([https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). These changes include:\n\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** A CoE is now mandatory for all student visa applications ([https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Genuine Student Requirement (GS):** The Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement, which assesses the applicant's intention to study in Australia ([https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n*   **Increased Financial Costs:** Students need to demonstrate sufficient financial resources to cover their tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, when advising the parents of a student who is ill and unable to attend classes, the education agent should emphasize the importance of obtaining medical documentation, notifying the education provider, and understanding the institution's policies on attendance and absences. By taking these steps, the student can minimize the potential impact on their visa and focus on their recovery. The agent should also be aware of the changes to student visa rules in 2025 and provide accurate information to the student and their parents.\n\n### References\n\n*   b1-overview.md\n*   b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md\n*   b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md\n*   b4-1-national-code-standards.md\n*   b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\n*   b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md\n*   b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\n*   b9-4-visas-following-study.md\n*   b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md\n*   b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   c6-1-sources-of-information.md*   d3-6-student-management.md\n*   a7-5-international-student-numbers.md\n*   a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md\n*   a8-4-health.md\n*   AIMS Education.

      "full_response": "## Report on Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) Requirements for Packaged Courses**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the query regarding a student undertaking a packaged course comprising an English Language Intensive Course for Overseas Students (ELICOS) program followed by a Masters of Biotechnology course, and the necessity of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the latter. The report will analyze the relevant regulations and guidelines to provide a well-supported recommendation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe student in question is enrolled in a packaged course, beginning with a 6-month ELICOS program and progressing to a Masters of Biotechnology. She has already paid tuition fees and OSHC for the ELICOS program. The university is now requesting OSHC payment for the Masters course as well. The counsellor seeks advice on whether this additional OSHC payment is required.\n\n**Analysis of OSHC Requirements**\n\nOverseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) is a mandatory requirement for international students holding a student visa (subclass 500) in Australia ([Edufirst Visa Consultancy](https://www.edufirstvisa.com/blog/everything-you-need-about-overseas-student-health-cover-oshc-in-australia)). It ensures that students have access to medical care during their stay in Australia without facing financial hardship ([Study in Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc)). The Department of Home Affairs mandates that students maintain continuous OSHC for the duration of their visa ([Study in Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc)). Failure to maintain valid OSHC can lead to visa cancellation ([Swinburne](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/courses/visas/overseas-student-health-cover/)).\n\n**Specific Requirements for Packaged Courses**\n\nFor students undertaking packaged courses, the visa duration typically covers the length of all courses included in the package, plus some additional time ([Immigration News Australia](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/)). This implies that OSHC should also cover the entire visa duration, encompassing all courses within the package ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025)).\n\n**Relevant Information from Local Documents**\n\nThe local documents provide further clarity on this matter:\n\n*   **b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md**: This document explicitly states that a student (and any accompanying family members) must have OSHC for the proposed duration of their student visa. This includes the entire period from the date of arrival in Australia on the student visa to the expiry date of the visa. If the cost of health insurance is not included in enrolment fees, the student will need to obtain OSHC insurance and provide OSHC policy details in the application.\n\n*   **b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md**: This document highlights the requirements of OSHC as a visa condition.\n\n*   **b9-1-visa-conditions.md**: This document lists condition 8501, which mandates that the student must maintain adequate health insurance during their time in Australia.\n\n**Exceptions to OSHC Requirements**\n\nThere are limited exceptions to the OSHC requirement. Students from Norway, Belgium, or Sweden may be exempt if they have acceptable health cover from their home country ([Kangaroo Edu](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025); [This is Australia](https://www.thisisaustralia.com/student-visas-and-courses/oshc-information/); [Swinburne](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/courses/visas/overseas-student-health-cover/)). However, this does not apply to the student in question.\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nFailure to maintain adequate OSHC coverage can have severe consequences, including visa cancellation and a potential ban on re-entry to Australia ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBased on the analysis of regulations, guidelines, and local documents, the student **needs to take out OSHC for the Masters course too before applying for a student visa as it is compulsory for international students to have health insurance for all courses in a package of offers while studying in Australia.**\n\n**Rationale**\n\n1.  **Visa Requirement:** OSHC is a mandatory visa condition, and students must maintain it for the entire duration of their student visa ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n2.  **Packaged Courses:** The student is undertaking a packaged course, and the visa duration will likely cover both the ELICOS program and the Masters course. Therefore, OSHC must cover the entire period ([B7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md)).\n3.  **Continuous Coverage:** The student must have continuous OSHC coverage from the date of arrival in Australia until the expiry date of their student visa ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n4.  **Compliance:** To comply with visa condition 8501, the student must have adequate health insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Australia ([B9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n5.  **Financial Protection:** OSHC provides access to medical care without financial hardship, covering doctor visits, hospital treatments, ambulance services, and limited pharmaceuticals ([Study in Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc); [Edith Cowan College](https://www.edithcowancollege.edu.au/how-apply/international/health-cover/)).\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Choice of Provider:** International students have the right to choose their OSHC provider, although education providers may make specific recommendations ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Policy Details:** Students need to provide details of their OSHC policy in their visa application ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Renewals:** If the student extends their visa, they must renew their OSHC to cover the extended period ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/how-to-study-in-australia/student-visas/overseas-student-health-cover)).\n*   **Transferring Providers:** Students can transfer to a different OSHC provider at any time, but some providers may charge a refund processing fee ([Studies in Australia](https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/how-to-study-in-australia/student-visas/overseas-student-health-cover)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the student must obtain OSHC coverage for the Masters of Biotechnology course to comply with visa requirements and ensure continuous health insurance coverage throughout their stay in Australia. This is essential for maintaining their student visa status and accessing necessary medical care.\n\n**References**\n\nEdith Cowan College.

      "full_response": "## Report on the Disclosure of Student Academic Records Under Privacy Laws\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis report addresses the scenario where parents of a 21-year-old student request an education agent to obtain their daughter's academic results from her institution. Based on an analysis of relevant Australian privacy laws, particularly the Privacy Act 1988, and international student privacy regulations, this report concludes that the institution should only release the student's academic results to the parents through the agent if the student provides explicit written consent. This conclusion is grounded in the legal principle that students over 18 years of age are considered adults with the right to control their personal information, including academic records.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe scenario presented raises critical questions about the balance between parental expectations, student privacy rights, and the legal obligations of educational institutions and agents. In Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 governs the handling of personal information, including student records. This legislation aims to protect the confidentiality of individuals' data and sets strict guidelines for its collection, use, and disclosure ([b2-5-the-privacy-act-1988.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-5-the-privacy-act-1988/)).\n\n### Legal Framework: Privacy Act 1988 and Student Privacy\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 is a cornerstone of Australian privacy law, establishing a framework for how personal information is handled by government agencies and private sector organizations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million AUD. The Act includes 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of personal information ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)).\n\nFor international students, these principles are particularly relevant. Educational institutions must only collect information necessary for their normal function and must inform students about the collection of their data. The use of this information is restricted to the purpose for which it was collected, unless the student agrees otherwise. Furthermore, institutions are obligated to protect student information from loss or misuse, and students have the right to access their information upon request ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)).\n\n### Privacy Concerns and Students Aged 18 or Over\n\nA key consideration in this scenario is the student's age. As the student is 21 years old, they are legally considered an adult under Australian law. This means that the right to control their personal information rests solely with them. Educational institutions are generally prohibited from disclosing a student\u2019s educational record to a parent without the student\u2019s written consent ([policies.northeastern.edu](https://policies.northeastern.edu/policy106/)).\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 recognizes that once a student turns 18, the rights previously held by their parents regarding access to their educational records transfer to the student ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa.html); [studentprivacy.ed.gov](http://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/parent-guide-family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa)). This principle is echoed in other countries with similar privacy laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in the United States, which also transfers rights to the student upon reaching 18 years of age ([zengrc.com](https://www.zengrc.com/blog/student-data-privacy-laws-by-state/)).\n\n### Academic Progress and Results: Consent Requirement\n\nIn the context of academic progress and results, the institution cannot provide information to the parents or the agent without specific written instruction from the student ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)). The institution is obligated to protect the student's privacy, even if the parents have paid for the student's education ([weber.edu](https://www.weber.edu/registrar/Parent_Info.html)).\n\nThe agent's role is to facilitate communication between the student and the institution, ensuring that the student is fully informed of their rights and options. The agent should explain to the parents that they cannot obtain the student's academic results without the student's explicit consent ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)).\n\n### Medical Situations and Privacy\n\nWhile the scenario focuses on academic results, it is important to briefly address medical situations. In cases where a student has medical problems, parents may expect the agent to investigate the issue. However, medical authorities may not agree to communicate with an agent or the education provider without the student's consent. In situations where a student is unable to communicate, medical authorities will typically communicate with the student's parents, spouse, or husband, unless the student has expressed a wish for them not to ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)).\n\n### Student Complaints and Appeals\n\nInternational students have the right to complain if they believe they have not received acceptable services. They also have the right to appeal adverse decisions, such as failing a subject or not meeting attendance requirements. Education providers must have a complaints and appeals process that students can follow ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\n### Implications for Education Agents\n\nEducation agents working in Australia are subject to privacy laws and must understand how information about individuals can be used ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)). Agents working outside of Australia need to be aware that certain institutions, such as hospitals, cannot provide information without the student's written permission. This can be confusing if it differs from the practices in the student's home country ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)).\n\n### The National Code 2018\n\nStandard 3.3.6 of The National Code 2018 requires that written agreements with students outline the circumstances in which personal information may be disclosed by the registered provider, the Commonwealth, or state or territory agencies, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)).\n\n### Best Practices for Handling Student Information\n\nTo ensure compliance with privacy laws and ethical standards, education agents should adhere to the following best practices:\n\n1.  **Obtain Consent:** Always obtain written consent from the student before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information.\n2.  **Inform Students:** Clearly explain to students how their information will be used and who it will be shared with.\n3.  **Protect Information:** Implement security measures to protect student information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.\n4.  **Provide Access:** Allow students to access their information upon request and correct any inaccuracies.\n5.  **Respect Student Autonomy:** Recognize that students over 18 have the right to control their personal information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the scenario presented, the institution should not provide the student's academic results to the parents or the agent without the student's explicit written consent. This is because the student is 21 years old and has the right to control their personal information under the Privacy Act 1988. The agent should work with the student to obtain the necessary consent, ensuring that the student is fully informed of their rights and options.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1.  The education agent should explain to the parents that they cannot obtain the student's academic results without the student's written consent.\n2.  The education agent should contact the student and request written permission to obtain and share their academic results with their parents.\n3.  The institution should only release the student's academic results to the parents through the agent after receiving written consent from the student.\n4.  Educational institutions should regularly train staff on privacy laws and best practices for handling student information.\n5.  Education agents should stay informed about changes to privacy laws and regulations to ensure compliance.\n\n### Reference List\n\n*   b2-5-the-privacy-act-1988.md. (n.d.). ICEF Academy.

      "full_response": "## Report on the Timeframe for Student Contacting DHA After Notification of Visa Breach\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the query regarding the timeframe a student has to contact the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and make an appointment after being reported by their education provider for breaching visa conditions. The report will analyze provided documentation and external web sources to determine the correct timeframe and provide a comprehensive understanding of the process. The information is crucial for education agents and international students to navigate visa regulations effectively.\n\n**Analysis of Provided Information**\n\nSeveral sources within the provided documentation shed light on the procedures following a report of non-compliance by an education provider.\n\n*   **Education Provider Responsibilities:** The education provider must have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory course progress ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n*   **Notification of Intent to Report:** The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report them to DHA. The letter must inform the student they have 20 working days to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n*   **Reporting to DHA via PRISMS:** Once the timeframe for appeal has lapsed, or the appeals process has been finalized in favor of the provider, the provider reports the visa breach using the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n*   **DHA Notification to Student:** After the provider reports the breach, the student receives a notice informing them that they must attend an Immigration office within 28 days, with a warning that failure to do so may result in visa cancellation ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** If the student fails to provide the institution with a current postal address, the formal letter might not reach them. However, the student visa can still be canceled, as it is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure the provider has their current postal address ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md)).\n\n*   **Valid Reasons for Non-Compliance:** A student may have a valid reason for non-compliance, such as illness, which needs to be supported by medical certificates. DHA may decide not to cancel the visa after an interview with the student ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md)).\n\n**Analysis of External Web Sources**\n\nExternal web sources corroborate and expand upon the information found in the provided documents.\n\n*   **Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation (NOICC):** The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) may send a NOICC if there are concerns regarding a visa status. Common reasons include non-compliance with visa conditions, use of bogus documents, or provision of incorrect information ([Migration Agents Perth, 2023](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation-noicc/)).\n\n*   **Time Limits for Responding to NOICC:** Generally, a student has 28 days from the date of the Notice to answer the question of whether their visa should be cancelled. There is a 14-day response time for answering whether they pass the character test ([Migration Agents Perth, 2023](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation-noicc/)).\n\n*   **Calculating the Time Limit:** To calculate the time limit to respond to a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation, look at the date on the last page of the Notice letter and add 7 working days if it was posted. Then add another 28 days (including weekends). If the Notice was faxed or emailed, add 28 days (including weekends) from the date on the letter ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n\n*   **Actions After Receiving the Notice:** It\u2019s crucial to write to DHA explaining why the visa shouldn\u2019t be canceled. The DHA prepares an Issues Paper for a decision-maker after collecting relevant information ([Migration Agents Perth, 2023](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation-noicc/)).\n\n*   **Factors Considered by DHA:** DHA considers factors such as the protection of the Australian community, the student\u2019s age when they arrived in Australia, the duration of their stay, and Australia\u2019s human rights obligations. Secondary considerations include family ties to Australia, age and health, links to the country of origin, potential hardship, and education level ([Migration Agents Perth, 2023](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation-noicc/)).\n\n*   **Extending Student Visas:** The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) expects students to complete their studies within the timeframe of their student visa; however, extensions are possible in certain circumstances. You can only apply to extend your student visa within 90 days of your current visa expiry date ([MyMurdoch Answers, 2025](https://myanswers.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/691/~/extending-student-visas---renewing-coe)).\n\n**Synthesis and Opinion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided documents and external web sources, the timeframe a student has to contact DHA and make an appointment after being reported by their education provider is **28 days**.\n\nThe education provider first issues a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA, allowing the student 20 working days to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process. Once this period has lapsed or the appeal is decided in favor of the provider, the provider reports the breach to DHA via PRISMS. Following this report, DHA sends a formal letter to the student, requiring them to attend an Immigration office within 28 days. Failure to comply may result in visa cancellation ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\nIt is important to note that the 28-day period starts from the date of the DHA notification letter. If the letter is sent via mail, additional time may be added to account for postal delays ([Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation/)).\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nGiven the strict timeframes and potential consequences, the following recommendations are crucial:\n\n1.  **Maintain Accurate Contact Information:** Students must keep their education provider informed of their current address in Australia. This ensures all formal notices are received promptly ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n2.  **Act Promptly Upon Receiving Notification:** Upon receiving a notification from DHA, students should immediately seek advice from a registered migration agent or legal professional to understand their rights and obligations ([Migration Agents Perth, 2023](https://migrationagentsperth.com.au/notice-of-intention-to-consider-cancellation-noicc/)).\n\n3.  **Gather Supporting Documentation:** Students should gather all relevant documentation to support their case, including medical certificates, letters of support, and any other evidence that explains their circumstances ([b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md](b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md)).\n\n4.  **Respond to DHA Within the Timeframe:** Students must respond to DHA within the 28-day timeframe, providing a detailed explanation of their circumstances and why their visa should not be canceled ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n5.  **Utilize Appeals Process:** If the student disagrees with the education provider\u2019s decision, they should utilize the internal and external appeals processes available to them ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n6.  **Stay Informed:** Students should stay informed about their visa conditions and any changes to immigration regulations by regularly checking the DHA website and consulting with education agents or legal professionals ([MyMurdoch Answers, 2025](https://myanswers.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/691/~/extending-student-visas---renewing-coe)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer to the query is **28 days**. After an education provider reports a student to DHA for non-compliance with visa conditions, DHA sends a letter to the student requiring them to attend an Immigration office within 28 days. Adhering to this timeframe is critical to avoid visa cancellation and potential exclusion periods. Students must maintain accurate contact information, act promptly upon receiving notification, gather supporting documentation, and respond to DHA within the given timeframe to protect their visa status.\n\n**References**\n\n*   b6-2-what-is-a-coe.md\n*   b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\n*   b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns.md\n*   b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   Migration Agents Perth.

Recent updates and policy changes in 2025 necessitate a clear understanding of the visa requirements and processes. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Australian student visa, addressing the query: \"A student visa in Australia: Is only necessary for students wanting to study at university; Is issued by DET under the Australia Act 1986; Is issued by DHA under the Migration Act 1958; Requires all students to study in Australia for a minimum of three years.\" This analysis will be based on reliable sources, including government publications, educational institution websites, and immigration news outlets.\n\n## Addressing the Query\n\nBased on the information available, the most accurate answer to the query is:\n\n*   **Is issued by DHA under the Migration Act 1958.**\n\nThe following sections will elaborate on why this answer is correct and why the other options are incorrect.\n\n### The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and the Migration Act 1958\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is the Australian government agency responsible for managing immigration and border control, including the issuing of visas [(\"Who Issues Australian Visas?,\" 2024)](https://www.mlamigration.com/post/who-issues-australian-visas). The legal framework governing the issuance of student visas is primarily the *Migration Act 1958* and associated migration regulations [(\"B2.4 The Migration Act 1958,\" n.d.)](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958/). This Act provides the DHA with the authority to assess visa applications and ensure they adhere to the country's immigration policies.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n1.  **Is only necessary for students wanting to study at university:** This statement is incorrect because student visas are required for various levels of education, not just university. The student visa (subclass 500) covers a wide range of study types, including primary and secondary school, vocational education and training (VET), English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS), and higher education [(\"Student visa (subclass 500) | Study Australia,\" n.d.)](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500).\n\n2.  **Is issued by DET under the Australia Act 1986:** This statement is incorrect.

Public universities will have a combined cap of approximately 145,000 new international students.\n\n4.  **Visa Prioritization:** A new visa prioritization system has been introduced, where student visas are marked as priority 1 if the education provider has not reached 80% of its allocated student threshold [(\"Australia\u2019s 2025 Visa Changes: What International Students Need to Know - Insider Guides,\" 2025)](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/). Once a provider reaches this capacity, applications are marked as priority 2 and processed more slowly.\n\n5.  **Restrictions on Onshore Visa Hopping:** Temporary Graduate and visitor visa holders are no longer able to apply for student visas from within Australia [(\"Australia\u2019s 2025 Visa Changes: What International Students Need to Know - Insider Guides,\" 2025)](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/).\n\n## Visa Conditions and Obligations\n\nStudent visa holders must comply with several conditions to maintain their visa status. These include:\n\n1.  **Maintaining Enrolment:** Students must maintain enrolment in a registered course and attend classes regularly [(\"B9-1 Visa Conditions,\" n.d.)](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions).\n\n2.  **Working Hours:** Students can work up to 48 hours per fortnight during their studies and unlimited hours during term breaks [(\"Australian Student Visa 500 - A 2025 Guide for International Students,\" n.d.)](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/).\n\n3.  **Informing Education Provider of Address:** Students must keep their education institution informed of their current address in Australia and notify them of any changes within 7 days [(\"B9-1 Visa Conditions,\" n.d.)](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions).\n\n4.  **Maintaining OSHC:** Students must maintain valid OSHC for the duration of their stay [(\"Australian Student Visa 500 - A 2025 Guide for International Students,\" n.d.)](https://immigrationnewsaustralia.com/australian-student-visa-500-a-2025-guide-for-international-students/).\n\n## Visas Following Study\n\nAfter completing their studies, international students may wish to remain in Australia to work. Several visa options are available, including:\n\n1.  **Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485):** This visa allows recent graduates to stay in Australia to gain work experience. The Post-Study Work stream of this visa is granted for 2-4 years, depending on the qualification [(\"B9-4 Visas Following Study,\" n.d.)](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/).\n\n2.  **General Skilled Migration (GSM):** Students may also apply for permanent residency under the GSM program, which is driven by the labor market needs of Australia [(\"B9-4 Visas Following Study,\" n.d.)](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Australian student visa program is governed by the *Migration Act 1958* and administered by the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Obtaining a student visa requires meeting several criteria, including providing a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), demonstrating English language proficiency, and proving sufficient financial capacity. Recent policy changes in 2025, such as the mandatory CoE and increased visa fees, aim to enhance the integrity of the visa system. International students must comply with visa conditions and are encouraged to seek guidance from registered migration agents to ensure a smooth application process.\n\n## References\n\n*   A7-5 International Student Numbers.

      "full_response": "## Keeping Updated on International Education Legislation and Regulations: A Detailed Report\n\nThe international education sector in Australia is subject to continuous changes in legislation and regulations. For education agents, staying informed about these updates is crucial for providing accurate advice to prospective students. This report aims to identify the most effective ways for agents to keep abreast of these changes, focusing on the roles of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and the Australian Education International (AEI). Based on the provided information, the answer to the query is **\"Both B and C\"**. This report will elaborate on why this is the most accurate answer.\n\n### The Importance of Staying Updated\n\nThe regulatory landscape of international education is complex and dynamic. Changes can arise from various factors, including shifts in government policy, economic conditions, and international relations. Recent examples include Australia's implementation of a cap of 270,000 new international student commencements for 2025 and the replacement of the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement with the Genuine Student (GS) requirement ([visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). These changes have significant implications for students and education providers alike.\n\nEducation agents play a vital role in guiding students through the application process and ensuring they comply with all relevant regulations. Providing outdated or inaccurate information can lead to visa refusals, financial losses, and reputational damage for both the student and the agent. Therefore, a proactive approach to staying informed is essential for maintaining professional standards and delivering quality service.\n\n### Department of Home Affairs (DHA)\n\nThe DHA is the primary government agency responsible for managing Australia's visa requirements, including student visas ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)). The DHA website is a key resource for up-to-date information on visa policies, application procedures, and eligibility criteria. The DHA also uses PRISMS to communicate information about international students to education providers for the purpose of obtaining and maintaining a valid student visa ([b6-1-access-to-prisms.md](b6-1-access-to-prisms.md)).\n\n**How the DHA Keeps Stakeholders Informed:**\n\n*   **Website Updates:** The DHA regularly updates its website with news, policy changes, and regulatory announcements ([eia.edu.au](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)). These updates cover a wide range of topics, including changes to visa requirements, processing times, and conditions.\n*   **ImmiAccount Login:** Education agents can access the DHA's ImmiAccount portal for registration requirements and eVisa access-related inquiries ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n*   **Direct Communication:** The DHA communicates directly with education providers through PRISMS, providing updates on student visa status and compliance requirements ([b6-1-access-to-prisms.md](b6-1-access-to-prisms.md)).\n*   **Social Media and Outreach:** The DHA utilizes social media platforms and outreach activities to disseminate information and engage with stakeholders ([eia.edu.au](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)).\n\n**Examples of DHA's Impact on Student Visas in 2025:**\n\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, all student visa applications, whether lodged inside or outside Australia, must include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). This replaces the previous system where a Letter of Offer was sometimes sufficient.\n*   **Onshore Application Restrictions:** The DHA has restricted onshore applications for student visas from individuals holding temporary visas, such as visitor visas, unless they meet all requirements, including holding a CoE ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n*   **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement:** The DHA replaced the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement with the Genuine Student (GS) requirement on March 23, 2024, to better assess applicants' intentions ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)).\n*   **Increased Scrutiny:** The DHA has increased scrutiny of high-risk student visas to identify genuine students, supported by a $19 million investment in the Home Affairs student visa unit ([eia.edu.au](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)).\n\n### Australian Education International (AEI)\n\nAEI, a division within the Australian Department of Education, plays a key role in promoting Australian education internationally and providing information on regulatory requirements ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)). While the provided text does not explicitly detail AEI's direct communication with education agents regarding legislative changes, the Department of Education, which oversees AEI, has responsibility for international education functions, including education agent performance data ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n\n**How AEI Supports Education Agents:**\n\n*   **Regulatory Information:** AEI develops and provides information on regulatory requirements and Australian education issues to education agents ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n*   **ESOS Act Monitoring:** AEI monitors provider obligations under the ESOS Act, ensuring that education providers comply with their responsibilities to international students ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n*   **Qualifications Recognition:** AEI engages with other governments concerning qualifications recognition, which is important for students seeking to continue their education or employment in Australia ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n*   **Data and Insights:** AEI provides data on international student numbers and trends, helping agents identify market opportunities and measure their own performance ([c6-marketing-information.md](c6-marketing-information.md)).\n\n### Other Important Resources\n\nIn addition to the DHA and AEI, education agents can utilize other resources to stay informed:\n\n*   **Education Provider Updates:** Education providers often provide updates on regulatory changes and visa requirements to their partner agents. Maintaining close communication with institutions is crucial.\n*   **Industry Associations:** Organizations like English Australia (EA) and the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) offer training workshops and resources for education agents ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)).\n*   **Legal Professionals:** Consulting with registered migration agents (RMAs) can provide expert advice on complex migration issues ([b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md)).\n*   **News Outlets and Publications:** Staying informed about news and analysis from reputable sources in the international education sector can provide valuable insights into policy changes and trends ([timeshighereducation.com](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/regulation-grows-international-education-enters-managed-era)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStaying updated on the ever-changing landscape of international education legislation and regulations is paramount for education agents. The DHA and AEI are both crucial sources of information. The DHA provides direct updates on visa policies and requirements, while AEI offers broader regulatory information and support for the international education sector. By actively monitoring these sources and utilizing other available resources, education agents can ensure they provide accurate and timely advice to prospective students, upholding professional standards and contributing to the integrity of Australia's international education sector. Therefore, the answer \"Both B and C\" is the most accurate.\n\n### References\n\n*   a7-5-international-student-numbers.md\n*   b2-1-the-esos-act.md*   b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md\n*   b4-1-national-code-standards.md\n*   b6-1-access-to-prisms.md\n*   b6-2-what-is-a-coe.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\n*   b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md\n*   b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md\n*   b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns.md\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\n*   c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md\n*   c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md\n*   c2-a-whos-who-of-australian-international-education.md\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   c5-6-student-support-services.md\n*   c6-marketing-information.md\n*   c6-marketing-information.md\n*   a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md\n*   [acenet.edu](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/ED-Finalizes-Biden-Regulations-Amid-Transition.aspx)\n*   [dha.gov.za](https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/2-uncategorised/7-legislation)\n*   [education.gov.au](https://www.education.gov.au/australian-strategy-international-education-2021-2030)\n*   [eia.edu.au](https://eia.edu.au/blog/recent-changes-on-australian-migration-strategy-and-student-visas-requirements/)\n*   [insiderguides.com.au](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)\n*   [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/australias-updated-student-visa-rules-2025-key-you-know-srivastava-qtylc)\n*   [msmunify.com](https://www.msmunify.com/msm-insights/reports/global-education-trends-2025/)\n*   [nafsa.org](https://www.nafsa.org/current-us-administration)\n*   [noborderslawgroup.com.au](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/major-changes-to-australian-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)\n*   [timeshighereducation.com](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/regulation-grows-international-education-enters-managed-era)\n*   [visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)\n*   [visaandimmigrations.com](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)"

      "full_response": "## Determining \"Health\" Reasons for Tuition Refunds: A Comprehensive Report\n\n**Introduction**\n\nInstitutions of higher education often have refund policies in place to address situations where students are unable to commence or continue their studies. These policies frequently include provisions for refunds when a student's inability to study stems from health-related reasons. However, the definition of what constitutes a valid \"health\" reason can be subjective and open to interpretation. This report aims to analyze the provided scenarios and determine whether they qualify as health reasons warranting a tuition refund, based on information from the provided sources and general principles of refund policies.\n\n**Analysis of Scenarios**\n\nThe following scenarios will be examined to determine if they qualify as a \"health\" reason for a tuition refund:\n\n1.  The student is homesick and wants to return home.\n2.  Death of a distant relative.\n3.  Student is hurt in a car accident.\n4.  Student decides to go to USA on a holiday.\n\n**Scenario 1: Homesickness**\n\nHomesickness is a common experience for students, particularly those studying abroad or away from their families for the first time. It can manifest as feelings of sadness, loneliness, anxiety, and difficulty adjusting to a new environment. While homesickness can be distressing, it is generally not considered a serious medical condition warranting a tuition refund.\n\nAccording to the University of Cincinnati's Tuition Refund Appeals Process, circumstances not sufficient to support a refund include dissatisfaction with the instructor or course, not being aware of add/drop deadlines, nonattendance or lack of participation, and dissatisfaction with course mode of instruction ([Tuition Refund Appeals Process - Tuition Refund Appeals | University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/about/bursar/refunds/tuition-refund-appeals-process.html)). Homesickness would likely fall under a similar category of personal dissatisfaction or difficulty adjusting, rather than a qualifying health condition.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that in some cases, homesickness can be severe and debilitating, leading to mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. If a student's homesickness is diagnosed as a mental health condition by a qualified healthcare provider, it may then be considered a valid health reason for a tuition refund. GradGuard Tuition Insurance covers mental health conditions such as stress, depression, or severe anxiety ([Tuition Insurance | GradGuard](https://gradguard.com/tuition-refund-insurance)).\n\n**Scenario 2: Death of a Distant Relative**\n\nThe death of a loved one is a difficult and emotionally challenging experience. While the death of a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, is often considered a valid reason for a leave of absence or withdrawal from studies, the death of a distant relative is less likely to be considered a qualifying health reason for a tuition refund.\n\nThe primary reason for this distinction is the degree of emotional impact and disruption to the student's life. The death of a close family member typically involves significant grief, bereavement, and potential responsibilities related to funeral arrangements and family support. These factors can make it difficult or impossible for a student to focus on their studies.\n\nWhile the death of a distant relative can still be a source of sadness and grief, it is less likely to have the same level of impact on the student's ability to study. Therefore, it is unlikely that the death of a distant relative would be considered a valid health reason for a tuition refund, unless the student can demonstrate that the event has had a significant and debilitating impact on their mental health.\n\n**Scenario 3: Student is Hurt in a Car Accident**\n\nA car accident resulting in injury is a more straightforward case for a health-related reason for a tuition refund. If the injuries sustained in the accident are serious enough to prevent the student from attending classes and completing their coursework, it would likely be considered a valid health reason.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati's Tuition Refund Appeals Process considers an acute medical condition as an illness or injury that significantly impacted the student\u2019s physical and/or mental health that required the student to withdraw the term or course ([Tuition Refund Appeals Process - Tuition Refund Appeals | University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/about/bursar/refunds/tuition-refund-appeals-process.html)). Documentation from a medical professional would be required to verify the nature and severity of the injuries, as well as the student's inability to attend school.\n\nGradGuard Tuition Insurance also covers covered serious injury or illness, such as mononucleosis or a severe head injury ([Tuition Insurance | GradGuard](https://gradguard.com/tuition-refund-insurance)).\n\n**Scenario 4: Student Decides to go to USA on a Holiday**\n\nA student's decision to go on holiday is not considered a health reason for a tuition refund. This is a voluntary decision unrelated to any medical condition or unforeseen circumstance. Refund policies are generally designed to address situations where a student is unable to study due to circumstances beyond their control, not for personal travel or leisure.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati's Tuition Refund Appeals Process lists circumstances ineligible for a refund, including inability to pay, lack of financial aid, or loss of external funding, dropping courses to avoid low grades, and dissatisfaction with the instructor or course ([Tuition Refund Appeals Process - Tuition Refund Appeals | University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/about/bursar/refunds/tuition-refund-appeals-process.html)). A student's decision to go on holiday would fall under a similar category of personal choice, rather than a qualifying reason for a refund.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Documentation:** In all cases where a student is seeking a tuition refund for health reasons, it is essential to provide adequate documentation from a qualified healthcare provider. This documentation should include a diagnosis, dates of treatment, and an explanation of how the health condition prevents the student from studying.\n*   **University Policies:** Students should be aware of the specific refund policies of their institution, including deadlines, eligibility criteria, and appeal processes.\n*   **Tuition Insurance:** Tuition insurance can provide additional protection against financial losses due to unforeseen circumstances, including medical withdrawals ([Tuition Insurance | GradGuard](https://gradguard.com/tuition-refund-insurance)).\n*   **Mental Health:** It is important to recognize that mental health conditions can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses. Students experiencing mental health difficulties should seek professional help and be aware of their rights regarding tuition refunds.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the scenarios and the information from the provided sources, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n*   Homesickness is generally not considered a valid health reason for a tuition refund, unless it is diagnosed as a mental health condition by a qualified healthcare provider.\n*   The death of a distant relative is unlikely to be considered a qualifying health reason, unless the student can demonstrate a significant and debilitating impact on their mental health.\n*   A car accident resulting in injury that prevents the student from attending classes would likely be considered a valid health reason for a tuition refund, with appropriate medical documentation.\n*   A student's decision to go on holiday is not considered a health reason for a tuition refund.\n\nIt is important for institutions to have clear and transparent refund policies that address a range of potential circumstances. Students should be informed of these policies and their rights regarding tuition refunds. In cases where a student's situation is not explicitly covered by the policy, a fair and compassionate assessment should be made, taking into account the individual circumstances and the available documentation.\n\n**References**\n\n*   GradGuard.

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report on the work rights of international students in Australia, adhering to the guidelines you've provided.\n\n### Report: Work Rights for International Students in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAustralia has long been a popular destination for international students, drawn by its high-quality education and vibrant student life ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)). A significant attraction is the opportunity to work part-time while studying, which helps students gain work experience and supplement their income. However, it's crucial for international students to understand and comply with the specific work regulations tied to their student visas. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the work rights of international students in Australia, focusing on the regulations, exceptions, and compliance requirements as of early 2025.\n\n**General Work Rights on a Student Visa**\n\nAs of July 1, 2023, the standard work arrangement for international students holding a student visa (Subclass 500) allows them to work up to 48 hours per fortnight during their academic sessions ([MQ Sydney](https://students.mq.edu.au/support/international/student-visa/work-rights); [Go Study Australia](https://www.gostudy.com.au/blog/change-to-student-visa-work-restrictions-for-international-students-in-australia/)). This regulation is designed to enable students to focus on their studies while still having the opportunity to earn income. During scheduled course breaks or official holiday periods, students can work unlimited hours ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n\n**Defining \"In Session\"**\n\nUnderstanding when a course is considered \"in session\" is crucial for adhering to work hour limitations. A student\u2019s course is generally considered to be in session during:\n\n*   The duration of advertised semesters, including exam periods ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/)).\n*   Periods when studies have been completed, but the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is still in effect ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/)).\n*   When a student is undertaking another course during a break from their main course, and the points will be credited towards their main course ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/)).\n\n**Specific Visa Conditions and Regulations**\n\nSeveral visa conditions apply to student visa holders, including:\n\n*   **Visa Condition 8105:** This condition specifies that students cannot work more than 48 hours per fortnight when their course is in session, unless the work is a registered part of their course ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/)).\n*   **Maintaining Enrolment and Course Progress:** Students must maintain their enrolment, attendance, and satisfactory course progress to comply with visa conditions ([TEQSA](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/about-us/news-and-events/latest-news/student-visa-holder-work-restrictions)).\n*   **Informing the Institution:** Students must keep their education provider informed of their current address in Australia and notify them of any changes within seven days ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/)).\n\n**Exceptions to Work Hour Restrictions**\n\nCertain categories of students and specific circumstances allow for exemptions from the standard 48-hour per fortnight limit:\n\n*   **Postgraduate Research Students:** Students enrolled in a Master's or Doctorate by research (subclass 574) can work unlimited hours once their course has commenced ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/); [Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).*   **Dependants of Students:** Dependants of student visa holders are generally permitted to work up to 48 hours per fortnight once the student has commenced their course. However, if the student is enrolled in a Master's or Doctorate degree registered on CRICOS, the dependant may work unlimited hours ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c5-8-ability-to-work/)).\n*   **Specific Industries:** During public health emergencies or in sectors with critical labor shortages (e.g., healthcare), the government may temporarily relax work restrictions ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)). For instance, in early 2023, there were temporary relaxations for those working in the aged care sector, but these have since been revised ([MQ Sydney](https://students.mq.edu.au/support/international/student-visa/work-rights)).\n\n**Consequences of Exceeding Work Hours**\n\nExceeding the allowed working hours can lead to severe consequences, including:\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** The Department of Home Affairs has the authority to cancel a student's visa for violating work hour conditions, often without prior notice ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/consequences-of-exceeding-work-hours-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   **Future Visa Applications:** A visa cancellation can negatively impact future visa applications to Australia, signaling non-compliance with Australian law ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/consequences-of-exceeding-work-hours-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   **Deportation:** Students may be required to leave Australia within a specified timeframe if their visa is cancelled. Failure to do so can result in deportation and a long-term ban from re-entering the country ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/consequences-of-exceeding-work-hours-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n*   **Impact on Studies:** Overworking can divert attention from studies, potentially leading to academic probation or expulsion from the enrolled program ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/consequences-of-exceeding-work-hours-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Compliance and Best Practices**\n\nTo avoid breaching visa conditions, international students should:\n\n*   **Track Working Hours:** Carefully monitor working hours to ensure compliance with the 48-hour per fortnight limit during academic sessions ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n*   **Prioritize Academics:** Ensure that work commitments do not negatively impact studies ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n*   **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with any changes in working regulations or visa conditions by regularly visiting official government websites, such as the Department of Home Affairs ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n*   **Seek Advice:** Consult with academic advisors and campus support services for guidance on managing work and study commitments ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/australiaimmigration/consequences-of-exceeding-work-hours-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)).\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Volunteer Work:** Even unpaid or volunteer work may be subject to work hour restrictions if the role would normally be undertaken by a paid employee ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-3-work-rights-for-students/)).\n*   **Fair Work Rights:** International students have the same workplace rights as Australian citizens, including minimum wage entitlements and protection against exploitation ([Migration Expert](https://www.migrationexpert.com.au/blog/working-on-a-student-visa-in-australia/)). As of 2025, the minimum wage in Australia is AUD $23.23 per hour ([Settlement Service, 2025](https://settlementservice.com.au/blogs/migrant-student/working-hours-for-international-students-in-australia-2025/)).\n*   **Tax File Number (TFN):** Students need to apply for a Tax File Number (TFN) from the Australian Taxation Office if they decide to work ([MQ Sydney](https://students.mq.edu.au/support/international/student-visa/work-rights)).\n\n**Post-Study Work Opportunities**\n\nAfter completing their studies, international students may be eligible for a post-study work visa, such as the Temporary Graduate Visa (subclass 485), which allows them to live, study, and work in Australia temporarily ([Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/understanding-work-rights-on-an-australian-student-visa-employment-rules-regulations/)). Eligibility criteria include completing a Bachelor's degree or higher from a recognized Australian institution and meeting English language requirements ([OTTO](https://ottostay.com.au/blog/navigating-student-visa-and-work-opportunities-in-australia)). Recent changes to the Temporary Graduate visa include reducing the age limit for applicants to 35 years and increasing the English language proficiency requirement ([ICEFAcademy](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the basic guideline that describes the work rights students have while on a student visa is that a student can work up to 48 hours per fortnight when their program is in session and unlimited hours during vacation times. This arrangement aims to strike a balance between enabling students to support themselves financially and ensuring they prioritize their academic pursuits. Compliance with these regulations is essential to avoid visa cancellation and maintain a successful educational journey in Australia. International students should stay informed, seek advice when needed, and carefully manage their work and study commitments to make the most of their time in Australia.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\nICEFAcademy.

      "full_response": "## Understanding Student Visa Condition 8202: A Comprehensive Report\n\nThe Australian student visa (subclass 500) is a crucial document that allows international students to pursue their education in Australia ([Student visa (subclass 500) | Study Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/student-visa-subclass-500)). However, this visa comes with specific conditions that students must adhere to throughout their stay. Among these conditions, visa condition 8202 is particularly significant, as it outlines the requirements related to enrollment, attendance, and course progress. This report aims to provide a detailed understanding of student visa condition 8202, clarifying its implications and addressing common misconceptions.\n\nBased on the provided information, the correct answer to the query \"A student visa issued with the condition 8202 means:\" is: **A student must be enrolled as a full-time student in a registered program.**\n\n### Defining Visa Condition 8202\n\nVisa condition 8202 mandates that students maintain enrollment in a full-time registered course that leads to a qualification at the same or higher level than the course for which the visa was initially granted ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)). This condition is applicable to students holding a subclass 500 visa and ensures they remain enrolled in the course for which they received their visa ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). The course must be registered with the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). Additionally, students must satisfy their education provider's requirements for attendance and course progress ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n### Key Components of Condition 8202\n\nTo fully grasp the meaning of condition 8202, it's essential to break down its key components:\n\n*   **Full-time Enrollment:** Students must be enrolled in a full-time course of study. This requirement ensures that students are genuinely committed to their education and are not using the student visa for other purposes ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Registered Course:** The course of study must be registered on CRICOS. This register lists all courses and institutions approved to offer education to overseas students ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **AQF Level:** Students must maintain enrollment in a course at the same or higher Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) level for which their visa was granted ([Attendance Condition 8202 on Student visa - Visa Envoy](https://visaenvoy.com/attendance-condition-8202-on-student-visa/)). This means that students cannot drop down to a lower qualification level without applying for a new visa ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). An exception exists for students changing from AQF level 10 (Doctoral Degree) to level 9 (Master's Degree) ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md)).\n*   **Attendance and Course Progress:** Students must maintain satisfactory attendance and course progress as required by their education provider ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)). This ensures that students are actively participating in their studies and are making reasonable progress towards completing their course. For school students, an attendance rate of 80% is generally expected ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n\n### Breaching Condition 8202: Consequences and Appeals\n\nFailure to comply with condition 8202 can lead to serious consequences, including visa cancellation ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)). Breaches of visa conditions, including 8202, can also make it difficult for students to obtain a bridging visa or another substantive visa in the future ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n\nCommon breaches of condition 8202 include:\n\n*   **Failing to maintain enrollment:** This occurs when a student withdraws from their course without enrolling in another registered course ([breaches of visa condition 8202 (i.e. maintaining enrolment, attendance and course progress)](b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md)).\n*   **Changing to a lower AQF level course:** As mentioned earlier, students cannot change to a course at a lower AQF level without applying for a new visa ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)). For example, changing from a Bachelor's degree to a Diploma would constitute a breach ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Failing to meet attendance requirements:** Consistently poor attendance can lead to a breach of condition 8202 ([Visa Condition 8202: Student Attendance Requirements](https://timpsonimmigration.com.au/students-attendance-visa-condition-8202/)).\n*   **Failing to make satisfactory course progress:** If a student is not meeting the academic standards set by their education provider, they may be in breach of condition 8202 ([Visa Condition 8202: Student Attendance Requirements](https://timpsonimmigration.com.au/students-attendance-visa-condition-8202/)).\n\nIf the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) believes that a student has breached condition 8202, they will notify the student of their intention to cancel the visa ([Common breach of conditions that lead to student visa cancellations](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)). The student then has 28 days to provide reasons why their visa should not be cancelled ([Common breach of conditions that lead to student visa cancellations](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)). Students have avenues of appeal if they are notified of the intention to cancel their visa ([Common breach of conditions that lead to student visa cancellations](https://visafaq.com.au/common-breach-of-conditions-that-lead-to-student-visa-cancellations/)).\n\n### Exceptions and Special Circumstances\n\nWhile condition 8202 is generally strict, there are some exceptions and special circumstances to consider:\n\n*   **Secondary Exchange Students:** Secondary exchange students are allowed to drop their level to 9 for their Master's education ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Foreign Affairs or Defence Sponsored Students:** Students funded by Foreign Affairs or Defence are also exempt from certain restrictions ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Completing Course Early:** Completing a course early does not constitute a breach of condition 8202, as long as the student follows the laws and conditions specified in their visa ([8202 Visa Condition: What Constitutes A Breach?](https://themigration.com.au/2023/06/16/how-8202-visa-condition-breached/)).\n*   **Changing Providers After Six Months:** Students who have completed at least six months of their principal course are generally free to change education providers ([Student Visas: Changing courses/providers](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). However, they must still notify the DHA of their change of provider ([Student Visas: When Can I Change My Provider? \u2013 Australian Immigration Law Services](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n*   **Changing Courses at the Same AQF Level:** If a student wants to change courses within the same institution and at the same AQF level, they will not require a new student visa ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n### The Role of Education Agents\n\nEducation agents play a crucial role in informing students about their visa conditions and responsibilities ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)). It is essential that agents provide accurate and up-to-date information to students to ensure they understand their obligations and avoid breaching their visa conditions. Agents should also be aware of the education provider's transfer policy and the written agreement with the student before attempting to enroll a student with a new education provider ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n### Recent and Upcoming Changes to Student Visas\n\nIt's important to note that the Australian student visa landscape is subject to change. As of January 1, 2025, all student visa applications must include a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), replacing Letters of Offer ([Australia Updates Student Visa Rules for 2025 to Ensure Genuine Applicants](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). Additionally, a cap of 270,000 new international student commencements will be enforced for 2025 ([Australia\u2019s New Student Visa Rules for 2025: Key Changes and What You Need to Know](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)). These changes underscore Australia's efforts to streamline immigration and prioritize quality in its international education programs ([Australia\u2019s New Student Visa Rules for 2025: Key Changes and What You Need to Know](https://visaandimmigrations.com/australias-new-student-visa-rules-for-2025-key-changes-and-what-you-need-to-know/)).\n\nFurthermore, the English language proficiency requirements for student visas have increased, with a minimum score of 6.0 now required for most applicants ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)). The base application fee for student visas has also increased to AUD $1,600 ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, student visa condition 8202 is a critical requirement for international students studying in Australia. It mandates that students maintain full-time enrollment in a registered course at the same or higher AQF level, and that they meet their education provider's requirements for attendance and course progress. Failure to comply with condition 8202 can lead to visa cancellation and other serious consequences. Students must understand their obligations and seek advice from education agents and registered migration agents to ensure they remain compliant with their visa conditions. The recent and upcoming changes to student visa regulations further emphasize the importance of staying informed and prepared.\n\n### References\n\n*   AIMS Education.

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Condition 8533: Address Notification Requirements in Australia\n\nThe Australian student visa program is designed to facilitate international students pursuing education within the country. However, these visas come with specific conditions that students must adhere to throughout their stay. One such condition is visa condition 8533, which mandates that students keep their education provider informed of their current address in Australia and notify them of any changes within a specified timeframe. This report aims to provide a detailed explanation of visa condition 8533, its implications, and the responsibilities it places on international students.\n\n### Understanding Visa Condition 8533\n\nVisa condition 8533 stipulates that student visa holders must inform their education institution of their current residential address in Australia [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")]. Furthermore, they are required to notify the institution of any changes to their address within seven days of the change [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")]. This condition is in place to ensure that education providers can effectively communicate with students and provide them with important information, such as formal notices, academic updates, and other relevant communications [(\"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\")].\n\n### Rationale Behind Condition 8533\n\nThe requirement to maintain an updated address with the education provider serves several critical purposes:\n\n1.  **Effective Communication:** Education providers rely on accurate address information to communicate with students regarding academic matters, administrative updates, and emergency situations [(\"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\")].\n2.  **Compliance Monitoring:** By maintaining current address information, education providers can better monitor student compliance with other visa conditions, such as attendance and course progress [(\"b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\")].\n3.  **Welfare and Support:** In cases where students require welfare support or assistance, having an accurate address allows providers to reach out and offer the necessary help [(\"b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md\")].\n4.  **Legal Compliance:** Condition 8533 is a legal requirement, and failure to comply can have serious consequences for the student's visa status [Saba K, 2024](https://intlstudents.com.au/student-visa-conditions-in-australia/).\n\n### Implications of Non-Compliance\n\nFailure to comply with visa condition 8533 can lead to several adverse outcomes for international students:\n\n1.  **Missed Communications:** Students who fail to update their address may miss important communications from their education provider, potentially affecting their academic progress or access to essential services [(\"b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\")].\n2.  **Visa Cancellation:** Repeated or serious breaches of visa conditions, including failure to maintain an updated address, can result in visa cancellation and the student being required to leave Australia [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n3.  **Exclusion Period:** In cases where a visa is cancelled for breaching visa conditions, the student may be subject to a three-year ban (exclusion period) on re-entry to Australia [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n\n### Student Responsibilities\n\nTo comply with visa condition 8533, international students must take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Provide Initial Address:** Upon arriving in Australia, students must provide their education provider with their current residential address within seven days [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n2.  **Update Address Changes:** If a student changes their address, they must notify their education provider within seven days of the change [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n3.  **Use Official Channels:** Students should use the official channels provided by their education provider to update their address, such as online portals, student services offices, or designated forms [(\"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\")].\n4.  **Keep Records:** Students should keep records of their address updates, including dates and confirmation receipts, as proof of compliance [(\"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\")].\n\n### Education Provider Responsibilities\n\nEducation providers also have a role to play in ensuring student compliance with visa condition 8533:\n\n1.  **Clear Communication:** Providers should clearly communicate the requirements of condition 8533 to students upon enrolment and during orientation programs [(\"b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md\")].\n2.  **Easy Update Mechanisms:** Providers should offer easy and accessible mechanisms for students to update their address information, such as online portals or dedicated forms [(\"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\")].\n3.  **Regular Reminders:** Providers should send regular reminders to students to update their address information, especially at the beginning of each semester or academic year [(\"b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md\")].\n4.  **Monitoring and Reporting:** Providers should monitor student compliance with condition 8533 and report any breaches to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) through the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) [(\"b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\")].\n\n### Temporary Changes and Considerations\n\nIt is important to note that temporary changes to visa conditions may occur due to specific circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Students should always refer to the latest information from the DHA and their education provider to ensure they are complying with the most up-to-date requirements [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n\n### The Broader Context of Student Visa Compliance\n\nCondition 8533 is just one of several conditions attached to Australian student visas. Other common conditions include:\n\n*   **Condition 8202:** Requires students to maintain enrolment in a full-time registered course, satisfy attendance requirements, and make satisfactory course progress [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n*   **Condition 8501:** Requires students to maintain adequate health insurance (Overseas Student Health Cover - OSHC) for the duration of their stay [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n*   **Condition 8105:** Restricts the number of hours students can work during term time [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n*   **Condition 8516:** Requires students to continue to satisfy the requirements for the grant of the student visa, such as maintaining sufficient financial funds [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")].\n\n### Advice from Education Agents\n\nEducation agents play a crucial role in advising students about their visa conditions and responsibilities. Agents should ensure that students are fully aware of the requirements of condition 8533 and the potential consequences of non-compliance [(\"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\")]. Agents should also provide students with resources and support to help them meet their visa obligations [(\"b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\")].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nVisa condition 8533 is a critical requirement for international students in Australia. By maintaining an updated address with their education provider, students can ensure effective communication, compliance monitoring, and access to essential services. Failure to comply with this condition can have serious consequences, including visa cancellation and exclusion from Australia. Therefore, it is essential for students to understand their responsibilities under condition 8533 and take the necessary steps to meet their obligations. Education providers and agents also have a role to play in supporting students and ensuring they are aware of their visa conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"The student must keep the education institution informed of their current address in Australia. They have 7 days to notify the institution of any changes\" accurately describes the requirement of student visa condition 8533.\n\n### References\n\n*   b1-overview.md\n*   b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18.md\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md\n*   b9-4-visas-following-study.md\n*   b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md\n*   c5-8-ability-to-work.md\n*   [Monash Student Association](https://monashstudentassociation.com.au/services/support-services/finance-advice/international-student-matters/student-visa-restrictions/)\n*   [Overseas Students Australia](https://overseasstudentsaustralia.com/student-visa-conditions/)\n*   [Global Select Education](https://www.globalselect.com.au/latest-updates/misconceptions-what-every-international-student-should-know-condition-8533)\n*   [MTTED](http://www.mtted.com/mttweb/english/visa/student_visa.asp)\n*   [Visa Verge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)\n*   [No Borders Law Group](https://noborderslawgroup.com.au/articles/major-changes-to-australian-student-visas-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/)\n*   Saba, K.

      "is_correct": true,
      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the query, adhering to the specified guidelines:### Report: Transfer Options for International Students on Packaged Courses in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nInternational students pursuing education in Australia under a student visa (subclass 500) often enroll in packaged courses, which involve a sequence of programs designed to lead to a principal course of study. A common scenario involves students undertaking an English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) program followed by a bachelor's degree. This report examines the options available to a student who has completed six months of their initial ELICOS program and seeks to change institutions, focusing on the regulatory framework governing such transfers.\n\n**Understanding Packaged Courses and Principal Courses**\n\nA packaged course is a series of courses designed to provide a pathway for international students to achieve a higher-level qualification. The principal course is the highest level of study the student intends to undertake in Australia ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration/)). For instance, a student might enroll in an ELICOS program to improve their English proficiency, followed by a foundation program, and then an undergraduate program ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration/)). The evidentiary requirements for the student visa application are typically based on the principal course ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration/)).\n\n**Regulatory Framework for Student Transfers**\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) National Code 2018 sets the standards for registered providers of education to overseas students. Standard 7 of the ESOS National Code specifically addresses the obligations when facilitating student transfers ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD7.aspx)). This standard aims to protect the integrity of the student visa program and ensure that students are genuinely committed to their educational goals ([australiavisa.com](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\n**The Six-Month Rule**\n\nA key provision within Standard 7 is the \"six-month rule,\" which stipulates that an overseas student cannot transfer from their original provider before completing six months of their principal course of study ([internationaleducation.gov.au](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD7.aspx)). The six months are calculated from the date the student commences their principal course ([australiavisa.com](https://www.australiavisa.com/2019/05/30/international-student-transfer-policy/)).\n\nIn the scenario presented, the student has completed six months of an ELICOS program, which is a preliminary course and not the principal course (the bachelor's degree). Therefore, the six-month rule related to the principal course has not been met.\n\n**Letter of Release**\n\nIf a student wishes to transfer before completing six months of their principal course, they generally require a letter of release from their current education provider ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/can-i-switch-universities-or-change-courses-in-australia-as-an-international-student-without-affecting-my-visa/)). A letter of release is a formal document from the current provider permitting the student to enroll at another institution ([studyadelaide.com](https://studyadelaide.com/whats-happening/changing-course-student-visa-australia)).\n\n**Specific Analysis of the Scenario**\n\nGiven that the student has completed six months of the ELICOS program but not of the bachelor's degree (the principal course), the following considerations apply:\n\n1.  **Letter of Release Requirement**: The student cannot transfer to another institution without a letter of release from the institution offering the bachelor's degree, as this is the provider of the principal course ([uts.edu.au](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/your-enrolment/enrolment-changes/international-students-transferring-another-institution)). Completing six months of the ELICOS program does not waive this requirement.\n2.  **Provider's Assessment**: The provider of the bachelor's degree program will assess the student's request for a release based on their documented transfer policy ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/obligations-when-facilitating-student-transfers)). This policy outlines the circumstances under which a transfer request may be granted or refused ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/obligations-when-facilitating-student-transfers)).\n3.  **Reasonable Grounds for Transfer**: The provider will consider whether there are reasonable grounds for granting the transfer request. Examples of reasonable grounds may include ([sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/release-for-student-visa-holders.html)):\n    *   The provider is unable to offer the course.\n    *   Evidence of compassionate or compelling circumstances that significantly impact the student's ability to progress with their planned study.\n    *   Government sponsorship considerations.\n4.  **Visa Implications**: If the student is granted a release and enrolls in a new institution, they must ensure that they continue to meet all student visa conditions ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). This includes maintaining enrollment in a registered course and adhering to attendance and academic progress requirements ([istudentplus.com](https://www.istudentplus.com/switching-courses-visa-implications-for-students/)).\n5.  **Changing to a Lower-Level Course**: If the student wishes to transfer to a lower-level course, they will need to apply for a new student visa ([studyadelaide.com](https://studyadelaide.com/whats-happening/changing-course-student-visa-australia)).\n\n**Exceptions to the Six-Month Rule**\n\nThere are limited circumstances in which a student may be able to transfer before completing six months of their principal course without a letter of release. These include ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/esos-providers/esos-requirements/obligations-when-facilitating-student-transfers)):\n\n*   The releasing registered provider or the course in which the student is enrolled has ceased to be registered.\n*   The releasing registered provider has had a sanction imposed on its registration by the ESOS agency that prevents the student from continuing their course.\n*   Any government sponsor of the student considers the change to be in the student\u2019s best interests and has provided written support for the change.\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nFailing to comply with student visa conditions, including transferring without a valid release or enrolling in a non-compliant course, can lead to visa cancellation ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/)). A cancelled visa may result in the student needing to return home and a potential three-year ban on re-entry to Australia ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/)).\n\n**Recent Amendments to Visa Conditions**\n\nIt is important to note that the Department of Home Affairs has been considering amendments to student visa conditions. As of July 1, 2022, there were intentions to add conditions prohibiting student visa holders from changing their course of study, including their major, thesis, or research topic, without permission from the Minister ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/student-visa-and-changing-courses/)). While these amendments primarily target tertiary education, it underscores the increasing scrutiny on course changes and the need for students to adhere strictly to visa conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, if a student has completed six months of their ELICOS program and wishes to change institutions before commencing their bachelor's degree, they will need to obtain a letter of release from the institution offering the bachelor's degree. Completing six months of the ELICOS program alone does not satisfy the requirements for a transfer without a release. The institution will assess the request based on its transfer policy and consider whether there are reasonable grounds for granting the release. Students must ensure they continue to meet all visa conditions throughout the transfer process to avoid visa cancellation.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   Students should consult with their education provider's international student support team to understand the transfer process and requirements.\n*   Students should carefully review their visa conditions and seek advice from a registered migration agent if needed.\n*   Education agents should provide accurate and up-to-date information to students regarding transfer policies and visa regulations.\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n*   a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a3-3-pathways-for-international-students/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a3-3-pathways-for-international-students/))\n*   a5-1-introduction-to-elicos.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-1-introduction-to-elicos/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-1-introduction-to-elicos/))\n*   a5-4-entry-points-and-costs.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-4-entry-points-and-costs/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-4-entry-points-and-costs/))\n*   a6-3-entry-requirements-and-costs.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a6-3-entry-requirements-and-costs/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a6-3-entry-requirements-and-costs/))\n*   b1-overview.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b1-overview/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b1-overview/))\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration/))\n*   b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/))\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-1-visa-conditions/))\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/))\n*   b9-4-visas-following-study.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/))\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia/))\n*   d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice/))\n*   [ACU](https://www.acu.edu.au/international-students/arriving-and-living-in-australia/applying-for-your-student-visa/release-int-students) Request for release.

      "full_response": "## Temporary Graduate Visa Options for Bachelor's Degree Graduates in Australia\n\n### IntroductionThis report addresses the options available to a student who has completed a three-year Bachelor's degree in Australia regarding their ability to work in Australia post-graduation. Specifically, it examines whether the student will be able to apply for a Temporary Graduate visa to work in Australia for up to two years following their graduation. The report will consider relevant visa streams, eligibility criteria, recent changes to visa regulations, and other factors that may influence the student's prospects.\n\n### Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485)\nThe Temporary Graduate visa (subclass 485) is designed to allow international students who have recently graduated from an Australian educational institution to remain in Australia temporarily to gain work experience ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). This visa has two primary streams: the Graduate Work stream and the Post-Study Work stream ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### Post-Study Work Stream\nThe Post-Study Work stream is available to eligible graduates of a higher education degree, offering extended options for working in Australia ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). Successful applicants under this stream may be granted a visa for two, three, or four years, depending on their highest educational qualification ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). For a Bachelor degree, the visa is typically granted for two years ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### Eligibility Criteria for the Post-Study Work Stream\nTo be eligible for the Post-Study Work stream, applicants must meet several criteria, including:\n1.  **Age Limit:** As of March 23, 2024, the age limit for applicants has been reduced from 50 years to 35 years ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n2.  **English Language Proficiency:** The English language proficiency requirement has been increased for applications lodged on or after March 23, 2024 ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). The minimum score required increases from IELTS 6.0 to 6.5 (or equivalent) with a minimum score of 5.5 for each component of the test (reading, writing, speaking and listening) ([visaenvoy.com](https://visaenvoy.com/graduate-temporary-485-visa/)).\n3.  **Australian Study Requirement:** All subclass 485 visa applicants must meet the Australian study requirement in the six months immediately prior to making their application, regardless of the stream that they are assessed under ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). This includes:\n    *   Attaining either a single qualification requiring at least two academic years of study or multiple qualifications resulting in a total period of at least two academic years of study ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Undertaking this study in no less than 16 months ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Lodging their application within six months of completing their course (when they received their results, not the Graduation ceremony) ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n4.  **Course Requirements:** The course/courses must also:\n    *   Be on CRICOS ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Have been successfully completed ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Have resulted in an eligible qualification ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Have had all instruction in English ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Have been completed while physically in Australia ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Have been completed while holding a visa allowing study in Australia ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Be counted only once towards the Australian study requirement ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n    *   Not be an English language proficiency course or enabling program ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### Analysis of the Student's Eligibility\nGiven that the student has studied a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Australia for three years, the following points can be made:\n1.  **Qualification Level:** A Bachelor's degree is an eligible qualification for the Post-Study Work stream ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n2.  **Duration of Study:** The Australian study requirement mandates at least two academic years (92 weeks) of study ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). Since the student has studied for three years, they meet this requirement, provided that the course is registered by CRICOS ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n3.  **Age:** Assuming the student is under 35 years of age at the time of application, they meet the age requirement ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n4.  **Other Requirements:** The student must also meet the English language proficiency requirement and other general criteria such as health and character requirements ([visahome.com.au](https://visahome.com.au/temporary-graduate-visa-in-australia-everything-you-should-know/)).\n\n### Graduate Work Stream\nThe Graduate Work stream is relevant to international students with an eligible qualification who graduate with skills and qualifications that relate to an occupation on Australia\u2019s Skilled Occupation List (SOL) ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). A visa in this stream is granted for 18 months ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)). If the student's qualification and skills align with an occupation on the SOL, they may also consider this stream.\n\n### Changes to Eligible Qualifications\nIt is important to note that changes to eligible qualifications for the Post-Higher Education Work Stream commenced from December 14, 2024 ([studyaustralia.gov.au](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/en/plan-your-move/your-guide-to-visas/temporary-graduate-visa-subclass-485)). These changes may impact the student's eligibility, and it is crucial to refer to the latest information from the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the information available, a student who has studied a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Australia for three years **will likely be able to apply for a Temporary Graduate Visa to work in Australia for up to two years following their Graduation**, provided they meet all the eligibility criteria for the Post-Study Work stream. These criteria include being under 35 years of age, meeting the English language proficiency requirement, fulfilling the Australian study requirement, and satisfying health and character requirements. The student should also ensure that their course is CRICOS-registered and that they apply within six months of completing their course.\n\n### Recommendations\n1.  **Consult the DHA Website:** The student should consult the DHA website for the most up-to-date information on visa requirements and eligibility criteria ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n2.  **Verify CRICOS Registration:** The student should verify that their course is registered on CRICOS ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n3.  **Prepare for English Language Test:** The student should prepare for and undertake an English language test to meet the required proficiency level ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n4.  **Gather Necessary Documents:** The student should gather all necessary documents, including academic transcripts, passport, and evidence of health insurance ([visahome.com.au](https://visahome.com.au/temporary-graduate-visa-in-australia-everything-you-should-know/)).\n5.  **Consider Graduate Work Stream:** If the student's skills and qualifications align with an occupation on the SOL, they should also consider the Graduate Work stream ([b9-4-visas-following-study.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-4-visas-following-study/)).\n\n### References\n\nb9-4-visas-following-study.md.

      "full_response": "## Report on Responsibility for Updating Student Address Information\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the query regarding the responsibility for ensuring an education provider has the current address of an 18-year-old student who has moved out of her homestay and into an apartment. The student is enrolled in a Foundation program in Australia. The report will analyze relevant regulations, policies, and guidelines to determine the responsible party. The analysis will be based on information from local documents and web sources, prioritizing relevance, reliability, and significance.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nBased on the provided information, the primary responsibility for ensuring the education provider has the current address of the student lies with the student. Several sources explicitly state this obligation.\n\n**Student's Responsibility**\n\n*   **Local Documents:** The document \"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\" clearly states, \"The student must keep the education provider informed of their current address in Australia. This is because all formal notices are sent to this address. If the address changes, the student must inform the education provider within 7 days.\"\n*   **Visa Condition 8533:** Document \"b9-1-visa-conditions.md\" mentions visa condition 8533, which likely mandates that students keep their education institution informed of their current address in Australia and notify them of any changes within 7 days.\n*   **University Policies:** Several university websites confirm this requirement. For example, La Trobe University states that international students must \"Notify the University of your Australian residential address within 7 days of your initial onshore arrival and every time you change your address\" ([La Trobe University](https://latrobe-current.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3242/~/study-requirements-for-international-students-on-student-visas)). Similarly, Murdoch University requires students to notify them of their residential address and any changes within seven days ([Murdoch University](https://myanswers.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/697/~/notifying-department-of-home-affairs-of-changes-to-my-address)).\n\n**Education Provider's Role**\n\nWhile the primary responsibility rests with the student, the education provider also has a role in ensuring they have accurate contact information.\n\n*   **ESOS Framework:** The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) framework places obligations on registered providers to collect and report relevant information relating to student visas ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework)).\n*   **Record Keeping:** Providers must keep records of each accepted student, including their current residential address, mobile phone number, and email address. Every six months, the provider must confirm with the student in writing that these details are still correct and update the records accordingly ([Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/international-providers-tps)).\n*   **Communication:** The education provider uses the student's address to send formal notices. This underscores the importance of having accurate address information ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Department of Home Affairs (DHA) Role**\n\nThe DHA is responsible for maintaining Australia\u2019s visa requirements and ensuring compliance with visa conditions ([c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md](c2-6-government-peak-bodies-and-other-organisations.md)). While the DHA does not directly contact students to update their address, they rely on the education provider to report any breaches of visa conditions, including failure to maintain accurate contact information.\n\n**AEI Role**\n\nThere is no mention of AEI being responsible for contacting the student and asking her to change her address.\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nFailure to keep the education provider informed of a current address can have serious consequences for the student.\n\n*   **Visa Cancellation:** Breaching visa conditions, such as failing to provide an updated address, can risk visa cancellation ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Missed Communication:** If the education provider does not have the student's current address, the student may miss important notices and communications, potentially leading to further complications ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n**Changes to Student Visa Requirements in 2025**\n\nIt is important to note that Australia is implementing stricter student visa requirements in 2025 ([Balasubramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-australias-stricter-student-visa-2025-balasubramanian-3jpnf/)). While the provided documents do not specify whether these changes directly impact the address update requirement, it is likely that compliance with all visa conditions, including maintaining accurate contact information, will be more closely monitored.\n\nOne significant change is the mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for all student visa applications from January 1, 2025 ([Sharma](https://imminews.com.au/major-change-to-australia-student-visa-requirements), [VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants), [Admission Ac Blog](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/05/australia-changes-rules-for-student-visas-check-new-requirement-for-a-student-visa-application/)). This change aims to ensure visa integrity and attract genuine international students. While the CoE itself may not directly relate to address updates, it signifies a broader effort to tighten visa requirements and ensure students are actively engaged in their studies.\n\n**Specific Considerations for Under 18 Students**\n\nAlthough the student in question is 18 years old, it is worth noting the specific requirements for students under 18. According to document \"b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\", an under 18 student must have the approval of their education provider to move to another address if they are not living with a parent, guardian, or relative. Since the student is now 18, this specific requirement no longer applies, but it highlights the additional level of oversight for younger students.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe student is responsible for informing her education provider of her change of address. The student is obligated to notify the education provider within 7 days of any change of address. While the education provider has a responsibility to maintain accurate records and the DHA oversees visa compliance, the onus is on the student to provide the correct information. Failure to do so can result in breaches of visa conditions and potential visa cancellation.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   Education agents should clearly inform students of their responsibility to update their address with the education provider upon arrival and whenever they change their address.\n*   Education providers should have clear and accessible procedures for students to update their address information.\n*   Education providers should regularly remind students of their obligation to maintain accurate contact information and the consequences of non-compliance.\n\n**References**\n\nAdmission Ac Blog.

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Requirements for Australia: A Detailed Analysis\n\nThe Australian Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has specific criteria that international students must meet to obtain a student visa. These requirements ensure that students are genuine, have the financial capacity to support themselves, and will comply with visa conditions. This report aims to determine which of the listed general requirements\u2014Overseas Student Health Insurance (OSHC), knowledge of Australian culture, arrangements for students under 18, and Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)\u2014is NOT a standard requirement for a student visa application. Based on a comprehensive review of recent updates and regulations, this report concludes that while OSHC, arrangements for students under 18, and CoE are essential, knowledge of Australian culture is not a documented requirement for student visa applications.\n\n### Core Requirements for Australian Student Visas\n\nSeveral sources confirm the core requirements for obtaining an Australian student visa. These include:\n\n1.  **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** As of January 1, 2025, a CoE is mandatory for all student visa applications, replacing the previous acceptance of Letters of Offer ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). The CoE confirms the student's acceptance into a registered course, details the course specifics, tuition fees, and program duration ([ImmiNews, 2025](https://imminews.com.au/australia-introduces-new-rules-for-student-visa-applications-in-2025-australia-immigration-news)).\n\n2.  **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement:** The Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement, effective from March 23, 2024 ([Kangaroo Edu, 2025](https://kangarooedu.au/blogs/navigating-australian-student-visa-requirements-in-2025/)). This assesses the applicant\u2019s intention to study in Australia through targeted questions about their studies, plans, and circumstances.\n\n3.  **English Language Proficiency:** Applicants must demonstrate appropriate English language skills, often through standardized tests like IELTS or TOEFL ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/visa-requirements-for-minors-studying-in-australia/)). The minimum score required is 6.0 for most applicants ([ICEF, n.d.a](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)).\n\n4.  **Financial Capacity:** Students must prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)). As of 2024, the minimum funds required are AUD$29,710 for a single student, AUD$10,394 for a spouse, and AUD$4,449 per dependent child ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n\n5.  **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** Adequate health insurance is mandatory for most international students to cover medical and hospital care ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)). OSHC must cover the entire duration of the student visa, from arrival to expiry ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)).\n\n6.  **Good Character:** Applicants must declare that they have not been involved in criminal activity or previously deported ([ICEF, n.d.c](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)).\n\n7.  **Arrangements for Students Under 18:** Students under 18 must provide evidence of adequate welfare arrangements for the duration of their visa or until they turn 18 ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). This can include living with a parent or legal custodian, a relative with a Student Guardian visa, or arrangements approved by the education provider ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n\n### Absence of Knowledge of Australian Culture as a Visa Requirement\n\nWhile cultural awareness is beneficial for international students adjusting to life in Australia, it is not a formal requirement for obtaining a student visa. The DHA focuses on ensuring that students are genuine, have the means to support themselves, and will adhere to visa conditions.\n\n#### Cultural Awareness and Adaptation\n\nAlthough not a visa requirement, cultural awareness is crucial for international students to integrate successfully into Australian society. Education agents play a vital role in preparing students for cross-cultural challenges, including understanding differences in teaching and learning environments ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness/)).\n\n#### Teaching and Learning Environment\n\nAustralian classrooms encourage initiative and questioning, which may differ from educational norms in other cultures ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness/)). Australian educators emphasize problem-solving and group projects, requiring students to collaborate and overcome interpersonal difficulties ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness/)).\n\n#### Language and Communication\n\nAustralians often use informal language, which can be confusing for international students accustomed to American or British English ([ICEF, n.d.e](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness/)). Understanding these nuances can help students communicate more effectively and feel more comfortable in their new environment.\n\n### Specific Requirements for Minors\n\nFor students under 18, additional welfare arrangements are mandatory. These arrangements ensure the safety and well-being of younger students while they are in Australia ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/age-requirements-for-australian-student-visa-applying-and-eligibility/)).\n\n#### Welfare Arrangements\n\nMinors must have adequate welfare arrangements in place for the duration of their stay, which can include:\n\n*   Living with a parent or legal custodian ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n*   Living with a relative who holds a Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n*   Having their education provider provide for their general welfare and accommodation ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n\n#### Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW)If a minor is not living with a parent or suitable relative, the education provider must issue a CAAW letter approving the student\u2019s welfare and accommodation arrangements ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)). The provider must specify the dates when they will take responsibility for the student\u2019s welfare ([ICEF, n.d.d](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-2-requirements-for-students-under-18/)).\n\n### Financial Requirements\n\nDemonstrating sufficient financial capacity is a critical requirement for obtaining an Australian student visa. Applicants must show they have access to funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/visa-requirements-for-minors-studying-in-australia/)).\n\n#### Evidence of Financial Capacity\n\nAcceptable sources of financial evidence include:\n\n*   Money deposit with a financial institution ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   Loan with a financial institution ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   Government loans ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   Scholarship ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n\n#### Minimum Funds Required\n\nAs of 2024, the minimum funds required are:\n\n*   AUD$29,710 for a single student ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   AUD$10,394 for a spouse or de-facto partner ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   AUD$4,449 per dependent child ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   AUD$13,502 per child for annual school costs ([ICEF, n.d.b](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n\n### Health Insurance Requirements\n\nAdequate health insurance is a mandatory visa condition. The DHA requires evidence of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) to demonstrate that the student is adequately insured ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)).\n\n#### OSHC Coverage\n\nOSHC typically covers visits to the doctor, some hospital treatment, ambulance cover, and limited pharmaceuticals ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)). The coverage must last for the entire duration of the student visa, from the date of arrival in Australia to the expiry date of the visa ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)).\n\n#### Exemptions\n\nSome students may be exempt from the OSHC requirement if they are from countries with reciprocal health care agreements with Australia ([VisaVerge, 2025](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/australian-visa-health-insurance-requirements-for-international-students/)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of current regulations and guidelines, it is evident that Overseas Student Health Insurance, arrangements for students under 18, and Confirmation of Enrolment are all essential requirements for obtaining an Australian student visa. While knowledge of Australian culture is beneficial for students to adapt and integrate into Australian society, it is not a documented requirement for the visa application process. The DHA prioritizes ensuring that students are genuine, have sufficient financial capacity, and will comply with visa conditions, with specific measures in place to protect the welfare of students under 18.\n\n### References\n\nICEF.

      "full_response": "## Student Visa Extension Options for Students Unable to Complete Studies: A Detailed Report\n\nThe scenario presented involves an international student enrolled in a three-year Bachelor of Arts program in Australia who experienced a significant health issue during her final semester, leading to concerns about completing her studies within the original visa timeframe. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the student's options, focusing on the possibility of extending her student visa. Based on the provided information, the most appropriate course of action is that the student **can apply for an extension to her student visa**. The student should gather relevant documents, including her passport and hospital records, and consult with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to discuss her situation.\n\n### Visa Extension Eligibility and Requirements\n\nSeveral sources confirm that international students may be eligible to extend their student visas under certain circumstances ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/); [ACU International, n.d.](https://www.acu.edu.au/international-students/arriving-and-living-in-australia/applying-for-your-student-visa/extend-your-student-visa)). The key is whether the student can demonstrate \"compassionate or compelling circumstances\" that have impacted their ability to complete their studies on time ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Student.ask.adelaide.edu.au, n.d.](https://student.ask.adelaide.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1606/~/as-an-international-student,-what-happens-if-i-will-not-complete-my-degree-by)).\n\n#### Compassionate and Compelling Circumstances\n\nAccording to the University of Canberra and Charter Australia, compassionate or compelling circumstances are generally defined as events beyond the student's control that significantly affect their course progress or wellbeing ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)). These circumstances can include:\n\n*   **Serious illness or injury:** A medical certificate is required to verify that the student was unable to attend classes due to their condition ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)).\n*   **Bereavement of close family members:** A death certificate should be provided if possible ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)).\n*   **Major political upheaval or natural disaster in the home country:** Emergency travel may be required, impacting the student's studies ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)).\n*   **Traumatic experience:** Involvement in or witnessing a serious accident or crime can significantly impact a student's wellbeing ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)). Police or psychologist reports may be required.\n\nIn the student's case, being admitted to the hospital for four weeks due to illness clearly falls under the category of \"serious illness or injury,\" which constitutes a compassionate or compelling circumstance. This provides a strong basis for applying for a student visa extension.\n\n#### Required Documentation\n\nTo support her application, the student should gather the following documents:\n\n*   **Valid passport:** Essential for any visa-related process ([VisaVerge, n.d.a](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension)).\n*   **Medical certificate/hospital records:** Documentation from the hospital confirming her admission and the duration of her stay ([Canberra University, n.d.a](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/international-students/current-international-students/accordions/intermissions); [Charter Australia, n.d.a](https://charter.edu.au/policies/deferment-suspension-and-cancellation-international-students)).\n*   **Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE):** A new CoE from the university indicating the extended duration of her studies ([VisaVerge, n.d.a](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension); [ACU International, n.d.](https://www.acu.edu.au/international-students/arriving-and-living-in-australia/applying-for-your-student-visa/extend-your-student-visa)).\n*   **Evidence of sufficient funds:** Demonstrating the ability to cover tuition fees and living expenses for the additional semester ([VisaVerge, n.d.a](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension); [Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)). As of May 10, 2024, students must demonstrate access to at least AUD 29,710 to cover living expenses ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n*   **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** Valid health insurance for the extended duration of her stay ([VisaVerge, n.d.a](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension); [ACU International, n.d.](https://www.acu.edu.au/international-students/arriving-and-living-in-australia/applying-for-your-student-visa/extend-your-student-visa)).\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) statement:** A statement explaining her reasons for needing the extension and her intention to return to her home country after completing her studies ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n\n#### Application Process\n\nThe student should follow these steps to apply for a student visa extension:\n\n1.  **Extend OSHC:** Ensure her health cover aligns with her intended visa period ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n2.  **Obtain a new CoE:** Request this from her institution promptly ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n3.  **Prepare necessary documents:** Gather all the required documents mentioned above ([VisaVerge, n.d.a](https://www.visaverge.com/questions/guide-to-extending-your-student-visa-in-australia-step-by-step-process-for-australian-student-visa-extension); [Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n4.  **Submit the application via ImmiAccount:** Complete the online application through the Department of Home Affairs portal ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n5.  **Pay the application fee:** As of July 1, 2024, the fee is AUD 1,600 ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n6.  **Undergo health examinations:** If required, attend any medical checks promptly to avoid delays ([VisaFast, n.d.](https://www.visafast.com.au/blog/student-visa-7/student-visa-extension-australia-23); [Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n\n#### Potential Challenges and Mitigation\n\n*   **Document delays:** Start gathering necessary documents early to avoid last-minute issues ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n*   **Financial proof:** Ensure bank statements or financial affidavits clearly demonstrate the required funds ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).\n*   **Application accuracy:** Double-check all information to prevent processing delays ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)).#### Bridging Visa\n\nProcessing times for visa extensions can vary, typically ranging from 4 to 6 weeks ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/)). If the student's current visa expires before a decision is made, a Bridging Visa A (BVA) will allow her to remain in Australia lawfully during the processing period ([Victory Group, 2024](https://www.victorygroup.au/2024/12/22/student-visa-extension-australia-essential-steps-and-updates-for-2025/); [Isamigrations, n.d.a](https://www.isamigrations.com/blog/student-visa-extension-in-australia/)).\n\n### Alternatives to Student Visa Extension\n\nWhile a student visa extension is the most likely option, it's important to consider alternatives:\n\n*   **Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485):** If the student has completed at least two academic years of study in Australia, she may be eligible for a Temporary Graduate Visa, which allows her to stay and work in Australia for a period of time ([This Is Australia, 2025a](https://www.thisisaustralia.com/news/why-the-15th-march-student-visa-deadline-is-critical/); [Vision Consultants, n.d.](https://visionaus.com.au/march-15-the-expiry-date-for-many-australian-student-visas-what-you-need-to-know/)). However, given that she needs only one more semester to complete her degree, this option may not be the most suitable.\n*   **Tourist Visa:** Applying for a tourist visa is not a viable option, as it only allows for a maximum of three months of study ([B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md); [B3-3-visitor-working-holiday-and-work-holiday-visas-and-study.md](b3-3-visitor-working-holiday-and-work-holiday-visas-and-study.md)). This is insufficient for completing a full semester of study.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information available, the student **can apply for an extension to her student visa**. Her hospital admission constitutes a compassionate and compelling circumstance, making her eligible for an extension. She should gather all the necessary documents, including medical records, a new CoE, evidence of financial capacity, and OSHC, and submit her application through ImmiAccount. It is also advisable to contact the DHA to discuss her situation and seek guidance on the application process.\n\n### References\n\nACU International.

Ensuring that students have avenues to voice concerns and seek resolutions is paramount for maintaining institutional integrity and student satisfaction. This report examines the veracity of several statements regarding student complaints, drawing upon provided documentation and external web sources to provide a comprehensive analysis. The goal is to clarify the processes, rights, and limitations surrounding student complaints in educational settings.\n\n**Analysis of Statements**\n\n**Statement 1: A student must access the institution\u2019s internal complaint process before they contact the OSO or State Ombudsman.**\n\nThis statement appears to be **TRUE**, based on the information available. Several documents emphasize the importance of exhausting internal institutional processes before seeking external intervention.\n\n*   **Internal Complaint Procedures:** Wilkes University explicitly states that students \"should first address any issues by contacting their instructor, if course-related, the program director or supervisor of the involved party\" ([Student Complaint Process | Wilkes University](https://www.wilkes.edu/about-wilkes/accreditation-and-rankings/student-complaint-process.aspx)). If resolution cannot be achieved, students should follow the institutional process outlined in the Internal Complaint Procedure. Similarly, for distance education students, an additional process is afforded, but only after exhausting all institutional options ([Student Complaint Process | Wilkes University](https://www.wilkes.edu/about-wilkes/accreditation-and-rankings/student-complaint-process.aspx)).\n\n*   **Federal Requirements:** WCET (the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies) notes that institutions should \"specifically indicate that the student must complete the institution\u2019s own complaint process before seeking external resolution of the issue\" ([Federal Student Complaint Requirements \u2013 Is Your Institution in Compliance Today? - WCET](https://wcet.wiche.edu/frontiers/2017/08/15/federal-student-complaint-requirement/)). This aligns with federal regulations requiring institutions to have a clear complaint process.\n\n*   **Overseas Student Ombudsman (OSO):** The document \"b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md\" states that the OSO may decide not to investigate a complaint if \"the student has not complained to the education provider first\" ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\nThis requirement ensures that institutions have the first opportunity to address and rectify issues, promoting internal accountability and resolution mechanisms.\n\n**Statement 2: Students cannot complain about their agent to the OSO or State Ombudsman.**\n\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The provided document \"b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md\" explicitly mentions that students do complain about their agents. Common complaints include:\n\n*   Giving false or misleading advice about a course or provider.\n*   Enrolling a student with one provider while telling the student they had been enrolled with a different provider.\n*   Accepting tuition fees before the student signed the written agreement.\n*   Failing to pass on tuition fees to the provider.\n*   Failing to give the student a copy of the written agreement, with the refund policy, so the student is unaware of their rights.\n*   Receiving a refund on behalf of a student when not authorized to do so in the student\u2019s written agreement with the provider.\n*   Receiving a refund on behalf of a student when authorized to do so but then failing to give the refund to the student ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\nThese complaints highlight the potential for agents to act unethically or provide misleading information, necessitating avenues for students to seek redress.\n\n**Statement 3: If a student contacts the OSO, the police will never investigate the complaint.**\n\nThis statement is **FALSE**. The OSO process and police investigations are not mutually exclusive. The document \"b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md\" indicates that the Ombudsman may decide not to investigate a complaint if \"another organization is better able to deal with the complaint (e.g. the police if it is a criminal matter)\" ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\nAdditionally, document \"c8-extension-useful-information.md\" mentions that police units may be specifically set up to handle crime and serious issues relating to international students, such as violence, extortion, and kidnapping ([c8-extension-useful-information.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c8-extension-useful-information/)).\n\nIf a complaint involves criminal activity, it is appropriate and necessary for the police to investigate, regardless of whether the student has also contacted the OSO. The OSO focuses on resolving disputes related to education services, while the police address criminal violations.\n\n**Statement 4: Students only have the right to complain in certain, specified circumstances.**\n\nThis statement is **FALSE**. While there are common categories of complaints, students have the right to complain if they believe the education provider has not followed the rules correctly or treated them fairly ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)). The common complaints according to the OSO are:\n\n1.  Refund & fee disputes (28%)\n2.  Transfer/release letter external appeals (16%)\n3.  Unsatisfactory attendance external appeals (11%)\n4.  Unsatisfactory course progress external appeals (9%) ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\nComplaints might also be about:\n\n*   Being refused admission to a course\n*   Course fees and due dates\n*   Graduation/completion certificates/academic transcripts\n*   Cancellation of enrolment\n*   Accommodation or work arranged by a provider\n*   Incorrect advice given by a provider\u2019s agent\n*   Inaction or delay, for example, failure by a provider to issue student results within the normal timeframes, or failure to provide services that were included in the student\u2019s written agreement with the education provider ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\nMoreover, institutions like American Public University System (APUS) are committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception ([University General Grievance Procedure | Student Handbook American Public University | American Public University](https://www.apu.apus.edu/student-handbook/university-policies-and-code-of-conduct/apus-consumer-information/university-general-grievance-procedure/)). They encourage students to approach University faculty and staff in instances where it is believed violations of policies or standards have occurred.\n\nThe right to complain extends to any situation where a student reasonably believes they have been treated unfairly or that the provider has not met its obligations.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Time Limitations:** The OSO does not investigate complaints where a student took more than 12 months to complain ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)). This highlights the importance of addressing issues promptly.\n\n*   **Ombudsman Role:** A student loan ombudsman is an independent and confidential resource that helps with student loans and sometimes federal financial aid concerns ([How To Work With A Student Loan Ombudsman \u2013 Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/work-with-a-student-loan-ombudsman/)). The ombudsman can help resolve disputes, review collections, and explain repayment options.\n\n*   **Complaint Resolution:** At the end of an investigation, the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider has not acted unreasonably, or may recommend that a provider remedy the problem by apologising, reconsidering a decision, providing a refund, providing clearer information, or changing a policy or procedure ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the analysis reveals that:\n\n*   Students are generally required to exhaust internal complaint processes before seeking external resolution.\n*   Students can indeed complain about their agents to the OSO or State Ombudsman.\n*   Contacting the OSO does not preclude police investigation if criminal activity is suspected.\n*   Students have broad rights to complain about unfair treatment or breaches of obligation, not limited to specified circumstances.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects of the student complaint landscape is crucial for educational institutions, agents, and students alike. By adhering to established processes and respecting student rights, institutions can foster a fair and supportive learning environment.\n\n**References***   b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/))\n*   b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/))\n*   b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md ([b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/))\n*   b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals.md ([b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals/))\n*   b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md ([b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission/))\n*   b2-1-the-esos-act.md ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/))\n*   b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/))\n*   b4-1-national-code-standards.md ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards/))\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions/))\n*   c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md ([c2-4-roles-international-student-support.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c2-4-roles-international-student-support/))\n*   c4-2-people.md ([c4-2-people.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-2-people/))\n*   c8-extension-useful-information.md ([c8-extension-useful-information.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c8-extension-useful-information/))\n*   d3-6-student-management.md ([d3-6-student-management.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d3-6-student-management/))\n*   Student Complaint Process | Wilkes University ([Student Complaint Process | Wilkes University](https://www.wilkes.edu/about-wilkes/accreditation-and-rankings/student-complaint-process.aspx))\n*   Federal Student Complaint Requirements \u2013 Is Your Institution in Compliance Today? - WCET ([Federal Student Complaint Requirements \u2013 Is Your Institution in Compliance Today? - WCET](https://wcet.wiche.edu/frontiers/2017/08/15/federal-student-complaint-requirement/))\n*   How To Work With A Student Loan Ombudsman \u2013 Forbes Advisor ([How To Work With A Student Loan Ombudsman \u2013 Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/work-with-a-student-loan-ombudsman/))\n*   Department of Education Complaints - Student Loan Borrowers Assistance ([Department of Education Complaints - Student Loan Borrowers Assistance](https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/find-help/file-complaints/department-of-education-complaints/))\n*   File Complaints - Student Loan Borrowers Assistance ([File Complaints - Student Loan Borrowers Assistance](https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/find-help/file-complaints/))\n*   Complaint : Student Conduct ([Complaint : Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.osu.edu/complaint))\n*   Student Consumer Complaint Process - Student Right to Know Act - Santa Clara University ([Student Consumer Complaint Process - Student Right to Know Act - Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/student-right-to-know-act/student-consumer-complaint-process/))\n*   University General Grievance Procedure | Student Handbook American Public University | American Public University ([University General Grievance Procedure | Student Handbook American Public University | American Public University](https://www.apu.apus.edu/student-handbook/university-policies-and-code-of-conduct/apus-consumer-information/university-general-grievance-procedure/))\n*   How to Deal with Student Complaints: The Gap Between Stimulus and Response - Higher Ed Professor ([How to Deal with Student Complaints: The Gap Between Stimulus and Response - Higher Ed Professor](https://higheredprofessor.com/2015/03/26/how-to-deal-with-student-complaints/))"

      "full_response": "## Report on Student Visa Requirements for Course Changes in Australia\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses the question of which proposed course changes might require an international student in Australia to obtain a new visa. The information is based on Australian student visa regulations, particularly those related to the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) and visa conditions. Recent updates and changes to visa policies, especially those implemented in 2024 and 2025, are also considered to provide a comprehensive overview. The report aims to provide clarity on the circumstances under which a student visa holder needs to apply for a new visa due to changes in their course of study.\n\n**Overview of Student Visa Regulations**\n\nAustralia's student visa program is governed by specific regulations designed to ensure that international students are genuine and maintain appropriate enrollment levels. The primary visa for international students is the Student visa (subclass 500) ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md)). A key condition for this visa is that students must maintain enrollment at the same or a higher AQF level for which their visa was granted ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md), [b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\nThe AQF is a national system of learning pathways that provides a clear structure for the level of each qualification ([a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md](a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md)). It allows students to progress from lower to higher levels and ensures that educational institutions understand the level of qualifications awarded by others ([a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md](a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md)).\n\n**Analysis of Course Change Scenarios**\n\nTo determine which course changes necessitate a new visa, each scenario provided will be analyzed based on AQF levels and visa regulations.\n\n1.  **Foundation Program to Bachelor of Business:**\n\n    *   Foundation programs are generally considered non-AQF courses ([a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md](a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md)).\n    *   A Bachelor of Business is an AQF level 7 qualification.\n    *   Changing from a non-AQF course to an AQF course is generally acceptable and does not typically require a new visa ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Therefore, a student moving from a Foundation program to a Bachelor of Business would likely **not** need a new visa, provided they meet the entry requirements for the Bachelor program and the visa remains valid.\n\n2.  **Bachelor of Business to Certificate IV of Business:**\n\n    *   A Bachelor of Business is an AQF level 7 qualification.\n    *   A Certificate IV is an AQF level 4 qualification.\n    *   Changing to a lower AQF level course is a breach of the student visa condition and may result in visa cancellation ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md), [b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Therefore, a student changing from a Bachelor of Business to a Certificate IV of Business **would** need to apply for a new Student visa ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n\n3.  **Undergraduate Program to Another Undergraduate Program:**\n\n    *   Both programs are at the same AQF level (typically AQF level 7 for Bachelor degrees).\n    *   If a student wants to stay at the same institution but wants to change courses with the same AQF level they will not require a new student visa ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   If the new course is longer than the original course, the student should apply for a further Student visa before their visa expires ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Therefore, a student changing from one undergraduate program to another **may not** need a new visa, unless the duration of the new course extends beyond the current visa's validity.\n\n4.  **ELICOS Program to Diploma in Business:**\n\n    *   ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) programs are generally considered non-AQF courses ([a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md](a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md)).\n    *   A Diploma in Business is an AQF level 5 qualification.\n    *   Changing from a non-AQF course to an AQF course is generally acceptable and does not typically require a new visa ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n    *   Therefore, a student moving from an ELICOS program to a Diploma in Business would likely **not** need a new visa, provided they meet the entry requirements for the Diploma program and the visa remains valid.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Visa Duration:** If the new course is longer than the original course, the student should apply for a further Student visa before their visa expires ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Six-Month Rule:** If a student has not completed six months of their principal course and wants to change education provider, they typically need permission from their current provider ([b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md](b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement:** As of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement has been replaced by a new Genuine Student (GS) requirement ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)). This involves answering targeted questions to assess the applicant's intentions and circumstances.\n*   **Financial Capacity and English Proficiency:** While evidence of finance and English is not always required with the visa application, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) retains the right to ask for financial evidence from any student if there is specific intelligence that suggests there may be a problem with the financial capacity of the student ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)).\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** The minimum English language proficiency requirement for student visas has increased, with a minimum IELTS score of 6.0 now required for most applicants ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Visa Subclass 500:** International students apply for a single Student visa (subclass 500) regardless of their chosen course of study ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md)).\n\n**Recent Changes and Updates**\n\nSeveral changes have been implemented in recent years that affect student visa requirements:\n\n*   **Increased English Language Requirements:** As of March 23, 2024, the minimum IELTS score for student visas increased from 5.5 to 6.0 ([migrationalliance.com.au](https://migrationalliance.com.au/immigration-daily-news/entry/2024-03-update-on-changes-esos-act-and-english-language-requirements.html), [blueskyconsultancy.com](https://blueskyconsultancy.com/australia-raises-the-bar-new-english-requirements-for-student-visa-and-temporary-graduate-visas/)). For packaged ELICOS courses, the requirement increased from 4.5 to 5.0 ([migrationalliance.com.au](https://migrationalliance.com.au/immigration-daily-news/entry/2024-03-update-on-changes-esos-act-and-english-language-requirements.html)).\n*   **Genuine Student Requirement:** The GTE requirement has been replaced by the GS requirement, focusing on targeted questions to assess the genuineness of the student's intentions ([b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md)).\n*   **Visa Application Fee:** As of July 1, 2024, the base application fee for student visas increased to AUD $1,600 ([b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md)).\n*   **Limitations on Onshore Applications:** The updated policy restricts onshore applications for those on temporary visas unless they meet all requirements, including holding a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) ([visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the course change that would most likely require a student to obtain a new visa is:\n\n*   **The student is studying in a Bachelor of Business and wishes to change to a Certificate IV of Business.**\n\nThis is because changing to a lower AQF level course is a breach of the student visa condition and may result in visa cancellation. The other scenarios, such as moving from a Foundation program to a Bachelor of Business, changing between undergraduate programs, or moving from an ELICOS program to a Diploma, generally do not require a new visa, provided the student meets the entry requirements for the new course and their visa remains valid.\n\nIt is crucial for international students to stay informed about the latest visa regulations and seek advice from registered migration agents or education providers to ensure compliance with visa conditions.\n\n**References**\n\n*   a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md\n*   b1-overview.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   [blueskyconsultancy.com](https://blueskyconsultancy.com/australia-raises-the-bar-new-english-requirements-for-student-visa-and-temporary-graduate-visas/)\n*   [migrationalliance.com.au](https://migrationalliance.com.au/immigration-daily-news/entry/2024-03-update-on-changes-esos-act-and-english-language-requirements.html)\n*   [visaverge.com](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants/)"

      "full_response": "## Understanding the \"Principal Course\" in Student Visa Applications: A Comprehensive Report\n\nThe process of applying for a student visa, whether it be for Australia or the United States, involves understanding specific terminology and requirements. One such term is \"principal course,\" which holds significant weight in determining visa eligibility and duration. This report aims to define \"principal course\" within the context of student visa applications, particularly for Australia, drawing upon provided documents and external web sources to provide a comprehensive understanding. The report will analyze the provided answer options and determine the most accurate definition based on the available information.\n\n### Defining the Principal Course\n\nBased on the provided information, the most accurate definition of \"principal course\" is: **That this is the course the student intends to take at the highest level.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by several key points extracted from the provided documents and web sources:\n\n*   **Australian Context:** The document titled \"b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\" explicitly states, \"The principal course is the course that the student intends to undertake in Australia at the highest level\" ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md)). It further illustrates this with an example of a student undertaking an ELICOS program, a foundation program, and then an undergraduate program, identifying the undergraduate program as the principal course.\n*   **Packaging Arrangements:** The same document emphasizes that when a student packages courses, the evidentiary requirements rating applied to the student visa application corresponds to the provider of the \"principal course\" ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md)). This highlights the importance of the principal course in the visa assessment process.\n*   **Law Insider Definitions:** Law Insider defines \"Principal Course of Study\" as \"the main course of study to be undertaken by an international student where the student visa has been issued for multiple courses, and is usually the final course of study\" ([Principal Course of Study Definition | Law Insider](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/principal-course-of-study)). This definition aligns with the concept of the principal course being the highest level of study within a package.\n*   **University of Tasmania Definition:** The University of Tasmania defines \"Principal course of study\" as \"The main course of study leading to the highest qualification on the student\u2019s current visa\" ([Principal course of study - Governance Instruments Framework | University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/policy/policy-definitions/definitions/principal-course-of-study)).\n\n### Why the Other Options are Incorrect\n\n*   **\"That the course must have a Principal in charge of it\"**: This option is incorrect because the term \"principal course\" refers to the level and type of study, not to an administrative role within the course.\n*   **\"That this will include a high school course\"**: While a high school course *could* be a principal course in some cases (e.g., a student coming to Australia solely for high school), the definition is not limited to high school courses. The principal course is the highest level of study, regardless of whether it's high school, vocational training, or higher education.\n\n### Implications of the Principal Course Designation\n\nThe designation of a principal course has several implications for student visa applicants:\n\n*   **Visa Assessment:** As mentioned earlier, the evidentiary requirements (financial capacity, English language skills, etc.) are often assessed based on the principal course. For instance, KBA Global notes that \"DOHA will use your main course of study to determine what financial and English language skills evidence you must submit with your student visa application\" ([Student Visa Australia (Subclass 500)](https://kbaglobal.com/student-visa-500/)).\n*   **Visa Duration:** The duration of the student visa is typically tied to the length of the principal course. According to \"b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md,\" the visa granted will generally cover the full length of every CoE (Confirmation of Enrolment) in a sequence or package, provided the visa requirements are met ([b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md](b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md)). The document also provides guidelines on how the duration of the course affects the duration of the visa, typically granting one to three months longer than the end date of the principal course.\n*   **Visa Conditions:** Student visa holders must maintain enrolment in a full-time registered course at the same or higher level than the course for which the visa was granted ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md)). This condition underscores the importance of completing the principal course or progressing to a higher level of study.\n*   **Transfer Restrictions:** Students may face restrictions on transferring to another education provider before completing a certain period (e.g., six months) of their principal course. Law Insider notes that students wanting to transfer to another provider will not be released unless they have completed 6 months in their Principal Course of studies ([Principal Course Definition | Law Insider](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/principal-course)).\n\n### Student Visa Requirements in Australia and the USA\n\nWhile the definition of \"principal course\" is similar in both Australia and the USA, the overall student visa requirements differ.\n\n**Australia (Subclass 500):**\n\n*   **Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) Requirement:** Applicants must demonstrate that they genuinely intend to stay in Australia temporarily for the purpose of study and will return to their home country after completing their studies ([Student Visa Australia (Subclass 500)](https://kbaglobal.com/student-visa-500/)).\n*   **Financial Capacity:** Students must prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and health insurance ([b1-overview.md](b1-overview.md)).\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** Applicants must demonstrate adequate English language skills through approved tests like IELTS or PTE Academic, unless exempt ([Student Visa Australia (Subclass 500)](https://kbaglobal.com/student-visa-500/)).\n*   **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC):** Maintaining adequate health insurance is mandatory for the duration of their stay ([b9-1-visa-conditions.md](b9-1-visa-conditions.md)).\n*   **Age Requirements:** There are age limits for students intending to study in the school sector ([b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md](b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md)).\n\n**USA (F-1 Visa):**\n\n*   **Acceptance to a SEVP-Approved School:** Students must be accepted into a program at a school certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) ([How to Apply for a U.S. Student Visa (F1) in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide - AloneReaders.com](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n*   **Form I-20:** The school will issue a Form I-20, which is essential for the visa application ([How to Apply for a U.S. Student Visa (F1) in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide - AloneReaders.com](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n*   **Proof of Financial Support:** Students must demonstrate sufficient funds to cover tuition and living expenses ([How to Apply for a U.S. Student Visa (F1) in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide - AloneReaders.com](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n*   **English Proficiency:** Proficiency in English is typically required, often demonstrated through TOEFL or IELTS scores ([How to Apply for a U.S. Student Visa (F1) in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide - AloneReaders.com](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n*   **Ties to Home Country:** Applicants must prove strong ties to their home country, indicating their intention to return after completing their studies ([How to Apply for a U.S. Student Visa (F1) in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide - AloneReaders.com](https://www.alonereaders.com/article/details/2399/how-to-apply-for-a-us-student-visa-f1-in-2025-a-comprehensive-guide)).\n*   **DS-160 Form:** Completion of the Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application ([USA Student Visa Guide 2025: Study in the U.S. \u2013 University HUB](https://universityhub.com/blog/your-roadmap-study-usa-comprehensive-student-visa-guide)).\n*   **Visa Interview:** Attending an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate ([USA Student Visa Guide 2025: Study in the U.S. \u2013 University HUB](https://universityhub.com/blog/your-roadmap-study-usa-comprehensive-student-visa-guide)).### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the \"principal course\" in the context of student visa applications refers to the course that the student intends to undertake at the highest level. This designation is crucial as it influences visa assessment, duration, conditions, and transfer restrictions. Understanding the definition and implications of the principal course is essential for students seeking to study in Australia or the USA. While specific requirements and processes may vary between the two countries, the underlying principle of the principal course remains consistent: it is the primary focus of the student's educational journey and the foundation upon which their visa eligibility is evaluated.\n\n### References\n\n*   b1-overview.md\n*   b2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md\n*   b7-4-packaging-arrangements-and-visa-duration.md\n*   b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md\n*   b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md\n*   b9-1-visa-conditions.md\n*   collegedunia.com.

      "full_response": "## Standard 1 of the National Code 2018: An Analysis of Marketing and Information Requirements for Education Providers\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) is a crucial legislative instrument in Australia's international education sector. Established under the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000, it sets nationally consistent standards designed to protect international students and ensure the delivery of quality education ([National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018)). The National Code comprises 11 standards, each addressing a specific aspect of the educational experience for international students. Standard 1, focusing on marketing information and practices, is particularly important in ensuring that prospective students receive accurate and reliable information to make informed decisions about their education in Australia ([Standard 1: Marketing information and practices - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/resources/standard-1-marketing-information-and-practices)).\n\nThis report aims to analyze the requirements of Standard 1 and determine the accuracy of the following statement: \"An education provider does not need to inform students about the duration, qualification, or fees that will apply to them if they study.\" Based on the available information, this statement is demonstrably false. Standard 1 mandates that education providers must ensure their marketing practices are professional, accurate, and maintain the integrity and reputation of the industry ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). This includes providing comprehensive and truthful information about course duration, qualifications awarded, and all associated fees.\n\n### Key Components of Standard 1\n\nStandard 1 of the National Code 2018 outlines several key requirements for education providers concerning marketing and information dissemination. These requirements are designed to protect international students from misleading or deceptive practices and ensure they have access to the information necessary to make informed choices.\n\n1.  **Accuracy and Integrity in Marketing:** Registered providers must ensure that all marketing materials and activities are conducted professionally and maintain the integrity and reputation of the Australian education industry ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). This means avoiding false or misleading information and presenting a realistic picture of the courses, facilities, and services offered.\n\n2.  **Clear Identification of the Provider:** Providers must clearly identify their name and CRICOS (Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students) number in all written marketing materials, including electronic formats ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). This ensures that students can easily verify the provider's registration status and credibility.\n\n3.  **Prohibition of False or Misleading Information:** Providers are explicitly prohibited from providing false or misleading information or advice regarding claims of association between providers, employment outcomes, automatic acceptance into other courses, possible migration outcomes, or any other claims related to the provider, its courses, or associated outcomes ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)).\n\n4.  **Comprehensive Information on Course Details:** While not explicitly stated within the provided documents that providers *must* inform students of the duration, qualification or fees, it is implied that this information must be accurate and not misleading. Standard 3, for example, requires formalization of enrollment and written agreements, which must include tuition and non-tuition fees payable ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](No URL available)). Standard 1 ensures that the marketing of courses and services is not false or misleading ([Standard 1: Marketing information and practices - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/resources/standard-1-marketing-information-and-practices)).\n\n### Implications of Non-Compliance\n\nFailure to comply with Standard 1 can have significant consequences for education providers. Breaches of the National Code can lead to sanctions, including suspension or cancellation of CRICOS registration, which would prevent the provider from enrolling international students ([ESOS National Code Information for Overseas Students and Staff - CQUniversity](https://www.cqu.edu.au/study/international/esos-national-code)). Furthermore, providing false or misleading information can also result in legal action under Australian Consumer Law, as Standard 1 now includes direct reference to it ([ESOS National Code Information for Overseas Students and Staff - CQUniversity](https://www.cqu.edu.au/study/international/esos-national-code)).\n\n### The Role of Education Agents\n\nEducation agents play a crucial role in recruiting international students for Australian education providers. Under the National Code, providers are responsible for the actions of their agents ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](No URL available)). Standard 4 of the National Code specifically addresses the responsibilities of registered providers in relation to education agents, emphasizing that providers must ensure their agents act ethically, honestly, and in the best interests of overseas students ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](No URL available)).\n\nProviders must have written agreements with their education agents, clearly outlining their responsibilities and the need to abide by the National Code ([b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md](No URL available)). These agreements must include provisions for corrective action and termination if the agent engages in dishonest or misleading practices ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](No URL available)). Providers are also required to enter and maintain details of their education agents in PRISMS (Provider Registration and International Student Management System) ([b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md](No URL available)).\n\n### Examples of Misleading Practices\n\nThe explanatory guide for Standard 1 provides examples of practices that would be considered breaches of the National Code ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). These include:\n\n*   Providing inaccurate information about the location of a campus where courses will be delivered.\n*   Making false comparisons with other providers.\n*   Marketing a course that is not yet registered for delivery to overseas students.\n\nThese examples highlight the importance of providing accurate and up-to-date information to prospective students.\n\n### ConclusionIn conclusion, the statement that \"An education provider does not need to inform students about the duration, qualification, or fees that will apply to them if they study\" is demonstrably false. Standard 1 of the National Code 2018 explicitly requires education providers to ensure that their marketing practices are professional, accurate, and maintain the integrity and reputation of the industry ([National Code Part D, Standard 1](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/nationalcodepartd/Pages/ExplanatoryguideD1.aspx)). This includes providing comprehensive and truthful information about course duration, qualifications awarded, and all associated fees. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant consequences for providers, including sanctions and legal action. The National Code 2018 serves as a critical framework for ensuring the quality and integrity of Australia's international education sector, protecting the interests of overseas students and upholding the reputation of Australian education providers.\n\n### References\n\n*   b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md (No URL available)\n*   b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md (No URL available)\n*   b4-1-national-code-standards.md (No URL available)\n*   b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md (No URL available)\n*   ESOS National Code Information for Overseas Students and Staff - CQUniversity.

      "full_response": "# English Proficiency Test Requirements for Australian Student Visas: An In-Depth AnalysisThe landscape of international education is constantly evolving, with countries like Australia adjusting their visa requirements to ensure the integrity of their education system and the success of international students ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). A critical component of these requirements is demonstrating English language proficiency, a factor directly linked to a student's ability to thrive academically and integrate into the Australian community ([B7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes/)). However, certain exemptions exist, and understanding these is crucial for both prospective students and education agents guiding them through the visa application process. This report aims to dissect the English proficiency requirements for Australian student visas, focusing on exemptions under regular evidentiary requirements, and providing a detailed analysis of the scenarios presented.\n\n## The Importance of English Proficiency\n\nAustralia, like the United States, recognizes that English language skills are fundamental for international students ([A7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs/)). Proficiency in English enables students to:\n\n*   Comprehend lectures and academic materials ([A7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs/)).\n*   Participate in class discussions and group projects ([A4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling/)).\n*   Write essays, research papers, and other academic assignments ([A7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs/)).\n*   Interact effectively with teachers, staff, and fellow students ([A4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling/)).\n*   Navigate daily life in Australia ([A4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling/)).\n\nRecognizing this, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) mandates that most student visa applicants demonstrate a certain level of English proficiency ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)). This is typically achieved through standardized tests like IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic, and CAE Cambridge ([A5-3-english-language-tests.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-3-english-language-tests/)). The minimum score required varies, but a score of 6.0 on the IELTS is generally expected for most applicants ([B7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications/)).\n\n## Streamlined vs. Regular Evidentiary Requirements\n\nThe Australian student visa application process operates under two main evidentiary frameworks: streamlined and regular ([B7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)). The framework applied to a student depends on a combination of their country of citizenship and the education provider they intend to enroll with ([B7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)).\n\n*   **Streamlined Evidentiary Requirements:** Students under this framework generally have lower evidentiary requirements. They may be able to satisfy the DHA of their financial capacity through a declaration and may not be required to provide upfront evidence of English language proficiency ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). However, the DHA retains the right to request further evidence if needed ([B7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)).\n*   **Regular Evidentiary Requirements:** Students under this framework face stricter requirements. They must provide evidence of both financial capacity and English language proficiency with their visa application ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n\n## Exemptions to English Proficiency Testing\n\nEven under regular evidentiary requirements, certain categories of students are exempt from having to present an English proficiency test score ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). These exemptions are designed to recognize alternative ways in which students may have already demonstrated adequate English skills. The exemptions include:\n\n1.  **ELICOS, Schools, Secondary Exchange, and Postgraduate Research Students:** Students enrolling in English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS), primary or secondary schools, secondary exchange programs, or postgraduate research degrees are typically exempt ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). For school students, this exemption acknowledges that their English proficiency will develop during their studies ([B8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/)).\n2.  **Recent Completion of Australian Education:** Students who have successfully completed specific levels of education in Australia within two years of their visa application may be exempt. This includes:\n    *   Requirements for a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education conducted in English in Australia ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n    *   A substantial component of a course leading to a qualification from the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) at Certificate IV level or higher, conducted in English while holding a student visa ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n3.  **Foreign Affairs and Defence Sponsored Students:** Students sponsored by Foreign Affairs or Defence are exempt ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n4.  **Citizens of Specific Countries:** Citizens holding a valid passport from the United Kingdom, United States of America, New Zealand, Canada, or Ireland are exempt ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n5.  **Study in English in Specific Countries:** Students who have studied for more than five years in English in Australia, United Kingdom, United States of America, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, or South Africa are exempt ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).## Analysis of Scenarios\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenarios presented in the query, considering the exemptions outlined above:\n\n*   **A student who completed high school in Nepal where all of the classes were conducted in English:** This student would likely **need** to present an English proficiency test score. While the classes were conducted in English, Nepal is not one of the countries listed for exemption based on citizenship or long-term study in English ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). The DHA requires specific evidence, and completing high school in English in a non-exempt country does not meet the criteria.\n*   **Chinese Students:** Chinese students would **need** to present an English proficiency test score. China is not on the list of countries whose citizens are exempt from providing English proficiency test scores ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). Therefore, unless they meet other exemption criteria (such as enrolling in ELICOS or completing specific Australian qualifications), they must provide test results.\n*   **A student who has completed 4 months of study in English in New Zealand:** This student would **need** to present an English proficiency test score. While New Zealand is on the list of countries whose citizens are exempt from providing English proficiency test scores ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)), this exemption does not apply to students who have completed 4 months of study in English in New Zealand.\n*   **A student who has completed two years of study in Australia prior to applying for a visa:** This student would **NOT need** to present an English proficiency test score. This scenario aligns with exemption number 2. If the two years of study involved successfully completing the requirements for a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education conducted in English, or a substantial component of an AQF Certificate IV or higher level course conducted in English while holding a student visa, the student is exempt ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nIt's important to note the following:\n\n*   **Institutional Requirements:** Even if a student is exempt from the DHA's English proficiency requirements for visa purposes, the education institution may still have its own English language entry requirements ([A5-4-entry-points-and-costs.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-4-entry-points-and-costs/)). Institutions are free to set their own standards, which may be higher than those required for the visa ([A7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs/)).\n*   **DHA Discretion:** The DHA retains the right to request evidence of English proficiency from any student, even those who might otherwise be eligible for an exemption ([B7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing/)). This is particularly true if there are concerns about the student's genuine intention to study or their ability to succeed in their chosen course.\n*   **Genuine Student (GS) Requirement:** As of March 23, 2024, the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement was replaced by the Genuine Student (GS) requirement ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)). While this change aims to streamline the application process, it's crucial to understand how the GS requirement may impact the assessment of a student's English language skills. The GS involves answering targeted questions to provide clearer insights into the applicant's intentions and circumstances ([B7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b7-3-streamlined-and-regular-evidentiary-requirements/)).\n*   **Visa Subclass 500:** International students generally apply for a Student visa (subclass 500) regardless of their chosen course of study ([B2-4-the-migration-act-1958.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-4-the-migration-act-1958/)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the Australian student visa process generally requires evidence of English proficiency, several exemptions exist. Based on the scenarios provided and the available information, a student who has completed two years of study in Australia, meeting specific criteria related to Senior Secondary Certificate of Education or AQF qualifications, would **not** need to present an English proficiency test score, assuming they are being assessed under regular evidentiary requirements. It's crucial for prospective students and education agents to carefully review the DHA's requirements and any institutional requirements to ensure a smooth and successful visa application. Furthermore, staying updated on policy changes, such as the shift from GTE to GS, is essential for providing accurate and timely advice.\n\n## References\n\nA5-3-english-language-tests.md. (n.d.).

      "full_response": "Here's a detailed report addressing the query about the purposes of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000, adhering to the specified guidelines.\n\n### Report: Purposes of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 is the primary Australian legislation governing the delivery of education to international students who come to Australia on student visas. It establishes a framework to ensure the quality of education and training institutions and to protect the interests of overseas students. Understanding the core objectives of the ESOS Act is crucial for education agents, providers, and students alike. This report aims to identify which of the provided options is *not* a main purpose of the ESOS Act, drawing upon available documentation and reliable sources.\n\n**Analysis of the ESOS Act's Objectives**\n\nBased on the provided information, the ESOS Act 2000 has three main objectives:\n\n1.  **To provide financial and tuition assurance to overseas students:** This ensures that students receive the education they have paid for. If an educational institution closes, students are provided with alternative tuition or a refund ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n\n2.  **To protect and enhance Australia\u2019s reputation for quality education and training services:** This involves ensuring that the education and training of overseas students meets national standards, that student welfare services meet national standards, and that education providers in the industry have integrity and act ethically ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n\n3.  **To complement Australia\u2019s migration laws:** This involves ensuring that education institutions do not allow or encourage students to breach their student visa conditions ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n\nConsidering these objectives, let's evaluate the provided answer options:\n\n*   **To establish and safeguard Australia\u2019s international reputation as a provider of high-quality education and training:** This aligns directly with the second main objective of the ESOS Act ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)). The Act aims to ensure that Australia maintains its standing as a provider of quality education.\n\n*   **To protect the interests of international students:** This is a core principle embedded throughout the ESOS Act. The Act's provisions for tuition assurance, refunds, and quality standards directly serve to protect international students ([b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/)).\n\n*   **To protect the interests of domestic students:** While the Australian government has initiatives to protect domestic students, this is not a primary objective of the ESOS Act. The ESOS Act is specifically focused on overseas students studying in Australia on student visas ([ESOS Act](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/esos-act)).\n\n*   **To support the Australian Migration program:** The ESOS Act complements Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of laws relating to student visas ([b2-1-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/)).\n\n**Detailed Examination of Tuition Protection and Student Welfare**\n\nThe ESOS Act mandates that providers registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) are responsible for the actions of their agents in relation to providing marketing and student information, recruiting and placing students, and acting honestly and in good faith, and in the best interests of the student ([b3-the-esos-act.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b3-the-esos-act/)). This underscores the Act's commitment to protecting international students from misleading or deceptive conduct ([b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/)).\n\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is a critical component of the ESOS framework. It ensures that international students receive a refund or are placed in an alternative course if their education provider defaults ([About the Tuition Protection Services (TPS) - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)). The TPS was established in 2012 and has been expanded to include certain domestic student cohorts, but its primary focus remains on international students ([About the Tuition Protection Services (TPS) - Department of Education, Australian Government](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps)).\n\n**The National Code of Practice 2018**\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) supports the ESOS Act by setting nationally consistent standards for education providers ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018/)). The National Code is a legislative instrument made under the ESOS Act and is legally enforceable ([ESOS National Code](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx)). Breaches of the National Code can result in enforcement action under the ESOS Act ([ESOS National Code](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx)).The National Code covers various aspects of student welfare, including orientation, support services, and monitoring student progress ([ESOS National Code](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx)). It also requires providers to have written agreements with education agents, outlining their responsibilities and termination conditions ([b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018/)).\n\n**Recent Amendments and Focus on Quality and Integrity**\n\nThe Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 indicates ongoing efforts to strengthen the ESOS framework ([Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 \u2013 Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7191)). The bill focuses on new requirements for the \u2018fit and proper\u2019 provider test, management of provider applications, registration requirements, and ministerial powers to determine enrolment limits on overseas students ([Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 \u2013 Parliament of Australia](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7191)). These amendments reflect a commitment to maintaining the quality and integrity of Australia's international education sector.\n\n**Role of Education Agents**\n\nEducation agents play a crucial role in the recruitment of international students. The ESOS Act describes how education providers must behave in relation to the recruitment of overseas students, including publishing a list of all its agents ([b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/)). Education providers must take all reasonable measures to use education agents that have an appropriate knowledge and understanding of the Australian international education industry and do not use education agents who are dishonest or lack integrity ([b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/)).\n\nAn education agent who acts professionally gives student applicants accurate and current information that is from trusted sources, such as government websites, and up-to-date advice from education providers ([b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/)). This ensures that students make informed decisions about their education and study options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the ESOS Act's objectives and related documentation, the option that is *not* one of the three main purposes of the ESOS Act 2000 is:\n\n*   **To protect the interests of domestic students.**The ESOS Act is specifically designed to protect the interests of international students studying in Australia on student visas, to uphold the quality of education and training services offered to them, and to complement Australia's migration laws. While domestic students benefit from other regulatory frameworks and initiatives, the ESOS Act's primary focus remains on the international student cohort.\n\n### References\n\n*   b1-overview.md\n*   b2-1-the-esos-act.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-1-the-esos-act/))\n*   b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-2-the-national-code-of-practice-2018/))\n*   b3-the-esos-act.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b3-the-esos-act/](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b3-the-esos-act/))\n*   b3-1-responsible-behaviour.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-1-responsible-behaviour/))\n*   b3-2-protection-for-international-students.md ([https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b3-2-protection-for-international-students/))\n*   b3-3-visitor-working-holiday-and-work-holiday-visas-and-study.md\n*   b4-the-national-code-of-practice.md\n*   b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md\n*   b2-an-introduction-to-regulations-and-legislation.md*   Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 ([https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00757/2018-06-19](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00757/2018-06-19))\n*   ESOS Act | Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency ([https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/esos-act](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/how-we-regulate/acts-and-standards/esos-act))\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act ([https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/ESOS-Act/Pages/default.aspx))\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Framework - Department of Education, Australian Government ([https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework](https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework))\n*   ESOS Framework | Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) ([https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about-us/asqa-overview/key-legislation/esos-framework))\n*   ESOS National Code ([https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Education-Services-for-Overseas-Students-ESOS-Legislative-Framework/National-Code/Pages/default.aspx))\n*   About the Tuition Protection Services (TPS) - Department of Education, Australian Government ([https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps](https://www.education.gov.au/tps/about-tuition-protection-services-tps))\n*   Information for international students ([https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Pages/Information-for-Students.aspx](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Pages/Information-for-Students.aspx))\n*   Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024 \u2013 Parliament of Australia ([https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7191](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7191))\n*   EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS ACT 2000 ([http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/esfosa2000442/](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/esfosa2000442/))"

      "full_response": "## Report on Key Aspects of the Australian Education System for International Students\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis report addresses a counselor's queries regarding the Australian education system, particularly concerning international students. It aims to clarify common misconceptions and provide accurate information to support effective guidance for prospective students. The report will evaluate the following statements and determine which is true based on the available data:\n\n1.  International students in Australian universities attend separate classes to local students.\n2.  A student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College.\n3.  International students receive better treatment than domestic students.\n4.  A student studying in an undergraduate program is more likely to enter into a Certificate IV than a Graduate diploma program upon completion of the undergraduate program.\n\n**Analysis of Statements**\n\n**1. International students in Australian universities attend separate classes to local students.**\n\nThis statement is generally **false**. While some universities may have specific campuses with a higher proportion of international students, the prevailing model in Australian higher education promotes integration. International students typically attend the same classes as domestic students, fostering a diverse learning environment ([a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md](a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md)).\n\n*   **Evidence:** The document \"a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md\" notes that international students have become very visible on Australian campuses and represent a significant portion of the total student population (10% to 30%). This suggests integration rather than segregation.\n*   **Rationale:** Internationalization strategies in Australian universities emphasize the international content of subject matter and the diverse profiles of students undertaking programs ([a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md](a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md)). Separate classes would contradict this approach.\n\n**2. A student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College.**\n\nThere is no direct evidence in the provided documents to confirm or deny this statement. However, it is plausible that ELICOS colleges have attendance requirements.\n\n*   **Inferences:** ELICOS providers and courses follow a quality assurance process that specifies minimum qualifications of teachers, class sizes, types of facilities, and the number of study hours per week ([a5-2-types-of-courses.md](a5-2-types-of-courses.md)). While attendance is not explicitly mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that attendance policies exist to ensure students benefit from the instruction.\n*   **Further Research:** To verify this statement, one would need to consult the specific policies of individual ELICOS colleges or regulatory guidelines for ELICOS providers.\n\n**3. International students receive better treatment than domestic students.**\n\nThis statement is **false**. While international students contribute significantly to the Australian economy and universities through tuition fees, there is no systemic evidence to suggest they receive preferential treatment over domestic students.\n\n*   **Equal Opportunity:** Australian universities generally aim to provide equal opportunities and support services to all students, regardless of their nationality.\n*   **Entry Requirements:** Entry requirements for international students can differ from those for domestic students, but this is due to the need to assess qualifications from diverse education systems ([Why are tertiary entry requirements different for international and domestic students? - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-15/university-offers-entry-scores-international-students-uni-fees/103314112)). These differences do not necessarily indicate better or worse treatment.*   **Support Systems:** Both domestic and international students have access to support systems within universities, including academic advising, counseling, and career services ([c4-pastoral-care-issues.md](c4-pastoral-care-issues.md)).\n\n**4. A student studying in an undergraduate program is more likely to enter into a Certificate IV than a Graduate diploma program upon completion of the undergraduate program.**\n\nThis statement is **false**. Upon completion of an undergraduate program (Bachelor's degree), a student is more likely to pursue a Graduate Diploma or a Master's degree than a Certificate IV.\n\n*   **AQF Levels:** The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) outlines the hierarchy of qualifications. A Bachelor's degree is typically at Level 7, while a Graduate Diploma is at Level 8, and a Master's Degree is at Level 9 ([The difference between Certificates, Diplomas and Degrees](https://www.upskilled.edu.au/faq/qualifications/difference-between-certificates-diplomas-degrees)). A Certificate IV, on the other hand, is at Level 4 ([Diploma vs. Certificate IV: Which Is Best for Your Career? | Swinburne Open Education](https://www.swinburneopen.edu.au/explored/careers/diploma-vs-certificate-iv-which-is-best-for-your-career)).\n*   **Career Progression:** Students pursue Graduate Diplomas or Master's degrees to gain further specialized knowledge and enhance their career prospects ([a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md](a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md)). A Certificate IV is typically pursued for entry-level vocational skills or career changes, which are less common after completing a Bachelor's degree.\n*   **Purpose of Qualifications:** Graduate Certificates and Diplomas are designed to broaden skills gained in an undergraduate program or develop vocational knowledge in a new professional area ([a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md](a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the available information, none of the statements are definitively true. However, the statement that is closest to the truth is:\n\n*   A student should attend at least 80% of all scheduled lessons in an ELICOS College.\n\nWhile there is no explicit evidence to confirm this, it is a reasonable assumption based on the quality assurance processes and the need for students to benefit from instruction.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo provide accurate guidance to international students, counselors should:\n\n*   Consult official university websites and publications for information on admission requirements, support services, and campus life.\n*   Refer to the Australian Government's Department of Education website for up-to-date statistics and policy information.\n*   Encourage students to attend orientation programs and seek advice from international student advisors.\n*   Stay informed about changes in visa regulations and education policies.\n\n**References**\n\n*   a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md\n*   a4-5-advantages-to-international-students.md\n*   a5-1-introduction-to-elicos.md\n*   a5-2-types-of-courses.md\n*   a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md\n*   a7-9-internationalisation-in-higher-education-in-australia.md\n*   c4-pastoral-care-issues.md\n*   Diploma vs. Certificate IV: Which Is Best for Your Career? | Swinburne Open Education.

Understanding this definition is crucial for education providers, international students, and education agents, as it directly impacts a student's ability to maintain their visa and continue their studies. This report will analyze the provided information, including local documents and web sources, to determine a concrete and valid definition of unsatisfactory academic performance. It will also explore the consequences of such performance and the processes involved in reporting and addressing it.\n\n**Defining Unsatisfactory Academic Performance**\n\nBased on the provided information, \"unsatisfactory academic performance\" is best defined as: **That a student has failed the majority of their subjects and would be unable to continue studying in their current course.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by several key pieces of evidence:\n\n1.  **Local Documents:**\n    *   Document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md` states that a student must achieve satisfactory academic results.

If the appeal is unsuccessful, further action is taken.\n    *   Document `b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md` explicitly lists \"unsatisfactory academic performance\" as one of the two reasons why an educational provider uses PRISMS (Provider Registration and International Student Management System) to report students to DHA (Department of Home Affairs) for non-compliance with student visa conditions.\n    *   Document `b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md` mentions \"breaches of visa condition 8202 (i.e. maintaining enrolment, attendance and course progress)\" as a factor considered in visa cancellations. Unsatisfactory academic performance directly contributes to a breach of this condition.\n\n2.  **Web Sources:**\n    *   Law Insider defines \"unsatisfactory academic performance\" as failing more than 50% of units in two consecutive study periods ([Law Insider](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/unsatisfactory-academic-performance)). This aligns with the concept of failing the majority of subjects.\n    *   Several universities' academic policies, such as those of College of San Mateo and Santa Monica College, define academic probation and dismissal based on GPA (Grade Point Average) falling below a certain threshold (typically 2.0) or failing to maintain satisfactory progress (completing less than 50% of enrolled units) ([College of San Mateo](https://collegeofsanmateo.edu/academicpolicies/probation.asp), [Santa Monica College](https://catalog.smc.edu/25-26/academic-policies/progress-probation-dismissal-policies.php)).\n    *   Colorado School of Mines defines unsatisfactory academic progress as failing to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater, receiving an Unsatisfactory Progress grade for research, or receiving an Unsatisfactory Progress recommendation from the department ([Colorado School of Mines](https://facultyhandbook.mines.edu/graduate/generalregulations/academicperformance/)).\n\n**Why the Other Options Are Less Accurate**\n\n*   **\"That a student has not attended class to the 80% required\"**: While attendance is a crucial aspect of student visa conditions, as highlighted in document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md`, it is a separate and distinct reason for reporting a student to DHA. Non-attendance and unsatisfactory academic performance are treated as two independent breaches of visa conditions.\n*   **\"That a student has not achieved the required English levels necessary to enter an undergraduate program\"**: This refers to the initial English language proficiency requirements for admission to a course, as mentioned in document `a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md`. While a student's English language skills can indirectly impact their academic performance, failing to meet initial English proficiency is a barrier to entry, not a definition of unsatisfactory performance during the course of study.\n\n**Consequences of Unsatisfactory Academic Performance**\n\nThe consequences of unsatisfactory academic performance for international students holding student visas are significant and can ultimately lead to visa cancellation. The process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Monitoring and Notification:** Education providers are required to have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory progress, as stated in document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md`.\n2.  **Written Notification:** If a student is deemed to be performing unsatisfactorily, the provider must issue a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. This letter must inform the student that they have 20 working days to access the provider's complaints and appeals process, as per document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md`.\n3.  **Appeals Process:** The student has the opportunity to appeal the provider's decision.\n4.  **Reporting to DHA:** Once the timeframe for appeal has lapsed, or the appeals process has been finalized in favor of the provider, the provider reports the visa breach using PRISMS, as mentioned in document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md`.\n5.  **DHA Notification:** After the provider reports the student, PRISMS generates a formal letter that is sent to the student, asking them to explain their circumstances to DHA, as stated in document `b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md`.\n6.  **Immigration Office Attendance:** The student will then receive a notice informing them that they must attend an Immigration office within 28 days. Failure to do so may result in visa cancellation, according to document `b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md`.\n7.  **Visa Cancellation:** If the student does not provide a valid reason for their non-compliance, or if DHA is not satisfied with their explanation, their visa may be cancelled, as indicated in document `b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md`.\n\n**Addressing Unsatisfactory Academic Performance**\n\nWhile the consequences are severe, universities and other educational institutions have a responsibility to help students who are struggling academically. Some strategies include:\n\n*   **Early Intervention:** Implementing systems to identify students at risk of failing early in the semester.\n*   **Academic Support Services:** Providing access to tutoring, study skills workshops, and academic advising.\n*   **Clear Expectations:** Ensuring students understand the course requirements and assessment criteria.\n*   **Flexible Assessment:** Offering alternative assessment methods to accommodate different learning styles.*   **Addressing Underlying Issues:** Recognizing that factors such as financial strain, health problems, and family responsibilities can contribute to poor academic performance, and providing support services to address these issues ([The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/failing-a-subject-isnt-just-the-students-fault-universities-can-and-should-help-126195)).\n*   **Open Communication:** Creating a culture where students feel comfortable seeking help without shame or embarrassment ([The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/failing-a-subject-isnt-just-the-students-fault-universities-can-and-should-help-126195)).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnsatisfactory academic performance, in the context of student visas, primarily refers to a student's failure to meet the academic standards required to progress in their course of study. This is typically manifested as failing the majority of their subjects, leading to academic probation or dismissal. Education providers have a responsibility to monitor student progress, provide support, and report non-compliance to DHA. Students, in turn, must maintain satisfactory academic performance to uphold their visa conditions. Understanding the definition, consequences, and processes related to unsatisfactory academic performance is crucial for all stakeholders in the international education sector.\n\n**References**\n\n*   a4-3-secondary-school-qualifications.md\n*   a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md\n*   a7-6-entry-points-entry-requirements-and-costs.md\n*   a7-8-which-are-the-best-australian-universities.md\n*   a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers.md\n*   b6-4-reporting-students-using-prisms.md\n*   b7-1-criteria-applied-to-all-student-applications.md\n*   b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md\n*   b8-4-examples-of-integrity-concerns-for-dha.md\n*   b9-2-meeting-student-visa-conditions.md\n*   b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md\n*   b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md\n*   c3-1-before-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md\n*   c4-2-people.md\n*   c7-3-qualification-authenticity.md\n*   c7-student-documents.md\n*   d2-3-ethics.md\n*   d3-6-student-management.md\n*   d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice.md\n*   \"Academic and Progress Probation and Dismissal Policies - Santa Monica College.\" *Santa Monica College Catalog*, [https://catalog.smc.edu/25-26/academic-policies/progress-probation-dismissal-policies.php](https://catalog.smc.edu/25-26/academic-policies/progress-probation-dismissal-policies.php)\n*   \"Academic Policies at College of San Mateo - Probation.\" *College of San Mateo*, [https://collegeofsanmateo.edu/academicpolicies/probation.asp](https://collegeofsanmateo.edu/academicpolicies/probation.asp)\n*   \"Failing a subject isn\u2019t just the student\u2019s fault.

      "is_correct": true,
      "full_response": "Here is a detailed report on student visas, focusing on the accuracy of the provided statements, written in markdown syntax and APA format:\n\n### Student Visa Requirements and Application Process: An In-Depth Analysis\n\nStudent visas are essential for foreign nationals intending to pursue education in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. These visas are non-immigrant documents that allow individuals to temporarily reside in a foreign country for educational purposes ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type)). Understanding the nuances of student visa applications is crucial for prospective international students. This report evaluates the accuracy of several statements regarding student visas, providing a comprehensive overview of the application process, eligibility, and associated requirements.\n\n#### Evaluating the Statements\n\nLet's analyze the accuracy of the provided statements based on the available information:\n\n1.  **\"The process an individual goes through in order to obtain a student visa is the same for everyone regardless of nationality or institution they will study with.\"**\n\n    This statement is **false**. The student visa application process varies based on nationality and the specific requirements of the country and educational institution. For instance, Indian students applying for a Canadian study permit can utilize the Student Direct Stream (SDS) for faster processing ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type)). Additionally, Australia has specific requirements such as the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) replacing Letters of Offer starting January 1, 2025, which impacts the application process ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants)). The type of institution (e.g., university, high school, vocational school) also dictates the specific visa type required, such as F-1, J-1, or M-1 visas for the USA ([EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education/international-student)).\n\n2.  **\"Students under 18 enrolling in a High School program do not need a student visa as they are not considered adults.\"**\n\n    This statement is **false**. Students under 18 enrolling in a high school program generally require a student visa. In the USA, minor children can obtain an F-1 student visa to attend private kindergarten through high school institutions, provided the school is SEVP-certified ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/student-visa-for-high-school-in-usa/)). While students 13 and younger may not be required to attend a visa interview, they still need a visa to study in the USA ([Leverage Edu](https://leverageedu.com/learn/student-visa-for-high-school-in-usa/)). The UK also offers a Tier 4 (Child) Student Visa for children aged 4 to 15 attending primary education ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type)).3.  **\"When the visa application states that an individual must be of good character, this means that they must have no criminal record or poor previous visa compliance record.\"**\n\n    This statement is **true**. The \"good character\" requirement in visa applications typically refers to the applicant's criminal history and compliance with previous visa regulations. For instance, Australia's Section 57 character requirement assesses criminal history, visa compliance, and behavioral risks ([Education ONE](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/s57-character-requirement-student-visa-australia/)). A criminal record, especially involving crimes against children, drug trafficking, or violence, can significantly impact visa approval ([Education ONE](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/s57-character-requirement-student-visa-australia/)). Similarly, previous visa breaches, such as overstaying or providing false information, are considered serious offenses ([Education ONE](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/s57-character-requirement-student-visa-australia/)). New Zealand also requires applicants for temporary visas to be of good character, considering criminal history and previous false information provided in visa applications ([Immigration NZ](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/character-and-identity/good-character)).\n\n4.  **\"There is no fee payable to apply for a student visa.\"**\n\n    This statement is **false**. Applying for a student visa involves several fees. In the USA, these include the SEVIS fee (ranging from $220 to $350 depending on the visa type) and the visa application fee ($160) ([Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)). Australia's student visa fee is AUD 1,600 as of July 1, 2024, and is non-refundable ([Insider Guides](https://insiderguides.com.au/australias-2025-visa-changes-what-international-students-need-to-know/)). These fees are essential for processing the visa application.\n\n#### Key Requirements for Student Visas\n\nTo provide a more detailed understanding, here are some key requirements for obtaining a student visa, particularly for the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada:\n\n*   **Valid Passport**: A valid passport is a fundamental requirement for all student visa applications ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type), [USCIS Guide](https://www.uscisguide.com/visa/nonimmigrant-visas/study-and-exchange/u-s-student-visa-document-checklist/)).\n*   **Acceptance Letter/Confirmation of Enrolment**: A letter of acceptance from a designated educational institution is crucial. In Australia, a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is now required instead of a Letter of Offer ([VisaVerge](https://www.visaverge.com/news/australia-updates-student-visa-rules-for-2025-to-ensure-genuine-applicants)).\n*   **Financial Clarity**: Applicants must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to cover tuition, living expenses, and other costs ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type)).\n*   **Language Proficiency**: Proof of language proficiency, such as IELTS or TOEFL scores, is often required ([Credenc](https://www.credenc.com/blog/student-visa-type)).\n*   **Medical Requirements**: Some countries, like the USA, have specific medical requirements, including documentation showing freedom from communicable diseases ([USCIS Guide](https://www.uscisguide.com/visa/nonimmigrant-visas/study-and-exchange/u-s-student-visa-document-checklist/)).\n*   **Good Character**: As discussed, applicants must demonstrate good character, with no significant criminal history or previous visa violations ([Education ONE](https://www.educationone.net.au/blog/s57-character-requirement-student-visa-australia/)).\n\n#### Types of Student Visas (USA)\n\nIn the USA, there are three primary types of student visas ([EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education/international-student), [Edwise International](https://www.edwiseinternational.com/blogs/usa-study-visa-for-international-students.html)):\n\n*   **F-1 Visa**: For students pursuing academic studies at a U.S. university, college, or school ([EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education/international-student)).\n*   **J-1 Visa**: For students participating in exchange programs, including scholars and researchers ([EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education/international-student)).\n*   **M-1 Visa**: For students in non-academic or vocational studies ([EducationUSA](https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education/international-student)).\n\n#### Application Process for a US Student Visa\n\nThe application process for a US student visa generally involves the following steps ([StudyAbroad Careers360](https://studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/how-apply-for-us-student-visa-in-2025), [Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)):\n\n1.  **Receive the I-20 Form**: Obtain the Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20) from the university or college ([StudyAbroad Careers360](https://studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/how-apply-for-us-student-visa-in-2025)).\n2.  **Pay the SEVIS Fee**: Pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee ([Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n3.  **Complete the DS-160 Form**: Fill out the online Nonimmigrant Visa Application (Form DS-160) ([Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n4.  **Pay the Visa Application Fee**: Pay the non-refundable visa application fee ([Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n5.  **Schedule an Interview**: Book an appointment for a visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate ([Yocket](https://yocket.com/study-in-usa/usa-student-visa)).\n6.  **Attend the Interview**: Attend the visa interview and be prepared to answer questions about your academic plans and financial support ([Admission Ac Blog](https://blog.admission.ac/2025/01/21/us-student-visa-heres-how-to-apply-types-of-visas-fees-application-deadline-and-more/)).\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the student visa application process is complex and varies depending on the destination country, the applicant's nationality, and the type of educational institution. The statement that \"When the visa application states that an individual must be of good character, this means that they must have no criminal record or poor previous visa compliance record\" is the most accurate among the options provided. Prospective students must carefully review and meet all requirements, including demonstrating financial stability, language proficiency, and good character, to successfully obtain a student visa.\n\n### References\n\nCredenc.

      "full_response": "## Report on the Disclosure of a 17-Year-Old Student's Results to Parents\n\nAs an education agent, the scenario presented involves a request from the parents of a 17-year-old student for their child's English program results. The central question is whether the English College can legally provide these results to the agent for dissemination to the parents. Based on the provided information, the English College **cannot** provide the student's results unless the student gives permission. This report will delve into the legal and ethical considerations surrounding student privacy in Australia, particularly concerning the Privacy Act 1988 and related regulations.\n\n### Legal Framework: The Privacy Act 1988\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 is a cornerstone of Australian privacy law, governing how personal information is handled by institutions and agents ([b2-5-the-privacy-act-1988.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-5-the-privacy-act-1988/)). The Act emphasizes the rights of individuals to have their personal details treated confidentially. This principle is particularly relevant in the context of education, where institutions hold sensitive information about students, including academic progress and results.The Act's implications for education agents are significant. Agents working in Australia are subject to privacy laws and must understand how information about individuals can be used ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)). Even agents working outside Australia need to be aware that certain information, such as medical details, cannot be disclosed by institutions without the student's written permission.\n\n### Privacy Concerns and Students Aged 18 or Over\n\nWhile the scenario involves a 17-year-old student, the documentation frequently references the age of 18 as a critical threshold for privacy considerations. For students 18 or older, information cannot be provided to parents without specific instruction from the student ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)). This is because, under Australian law, an individual is legally considered an adult at 18.\n\nAlthough the student in this scenario is 17, the underlying principle of respecting student privacy remains paramount. The fact that the student is not yet 18 does not automatically grant parents the right to access their academic records without the student's consent.\n\n### Obtaining Academic Progress Information\n\nThe documentation explicitly addresses the question of whether an agent can obtain information about a student's academic progress to provide to a parent or guardian ([b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)). The answer is clear:*   **Yes** \u2013 If the student gives their consent in writing for the education provider to provide the results.\n*   **No** \u2013 If the student does not want to give their consent.\n*   **No** \u2013 If the student is not available to give their consent. Academic results cannot be obtained even if the agent thinks that the student will agree to provide them.\n\nThis underscores the importance of obtaining explicit, written consent from the student before seeking their academic results. The agent's belief that the student would agree is insufficient; actual consent is required.\n\n### Implications for Education Agents\n\nAs an education agent, it is crucial to understand and adhere to privacy principles when dealing with student information ([c7-1-dealing-with-student-documents.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c7-1-dealing-with-student-documents/)). Agents should not disclose personal information to anyone who does not have a legitimate reason to access it and must take reasonable steps to ensure the proper security of student information.\n\nFurthermore, agents have an ethical obligation to protect students' personal details ([d2-3-ethics.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d2-3-ethics/)). This includes treating information confidentially and carefully and not passing it on to other businesses or people without the student's permission.\n\n### The National Code 2018\n\nThe National Code 2018 also emphasizes the importance of privacy. Standard 3.3.6 states that a written agreement with a student must set out the circumstances in which personal information about the student may be disclosed by the registered provider, the Commonwealth (including the TPS), or state or territory agencies, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 ([b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)).\n\n### Access to Student Records Policy - ACT Education Directorate\n\nThe ACT Education Directorate's Access Student Records Policy reinforces the importance of safeguarding student records from unauthorized access ([Access Student Records Policy - Education](https://www.education.act.gov.au/publications_and_policies/corporate-policies/student-administration/student-records/access-student-records-policy/access-student-records-policy)). The policy states that the Directorate will use and disclose personal information only within the requirements of privacy and other legislation. Individuals have a right to seek access to their own personal information and personal health information.\n\n### FERPA (United States)\n\nWhile the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a United States law, understanding its principles can provide additional context to the importance of student privacy ([FERPA Overview - Presidents' Alliance](https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/effective_practice/ferpa-overview/)). FERPA protects personally identifiable information (PII) contained in students' educational records. Although FERPA does not directly apply in Australia, it highlights the global recognition of the need to protect student data.\n\n### Sharing Information Outside the Department (NSW)\n\nThe NSW Department of Education provides guidelines on sharing information outside the department, emphasizing that schools cannot disclose a student's personal information unless certain conditions are met ([Sharing information outside the department](https://education.nsw.gov.au/rights-and-accountability/privacy/privacy-information-and-forms/sharing-information-outside-the-department)). These conditions include:\n\n*   The release is directly to the student.\n*   The disclosure is directly related to the purpose the information was collected, and the school does not have any reason to believe the student (or their parent or carer) would object.\n*   The student or their parent or carer has provided consent.\n*   There is a legal requirement or authority.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the English College is legally obligated to protect the privacy of the 17-year-old student's academic results. Unless the student provides explicit, written consent, the college cannot release the results to the education agent for dissemination to the parents. This position aligns with the Privacy Act 1988, the National Code 2018, and ethical considerations for education agents. Agents must prioritize student privacy and obtain proper consent before seeking access to sensitive information.\n\n### References\n\n*   Access Student Records Policy - Education.

      "full_response": "# CRICOS Provider and Course Codes: A Detailed Analysis\n\nThe Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) is a critical component of Australia's international education framework. It ensures that educational institutions and courses offered to overseas students meet specific standards and regulatory requirements. Understanding the structure and significance of CRICOS provider and course codes is essential for education agents, institutions, and international students alike. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of CRICOS codes, focusing on their uniqueness, importance, and how they relate to educational offerings.\n\n## Understanding CRICOS Codes\n\nCRICOS is an online register of all courses and institutions available to students seeking an Australian student visa ([B5-cricos.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b5-cricos/)). The CRICOS system ensures that the courses and institutions listed meet the standards mandated by the Australian Government ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)).\n\n### CRICOS Provider Code\n\nEach institution registered with CRICOS receives a unique provider code. This code identifies the institution as an approved provider of education and training services to overseas students ([b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)). The provider code is legally required to be included in all marketing materials, typically found at the bottom of each webpage on an institution's website ([b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)).\n\n**Importance of the Provider Code:**\n\n*   **Identification:** It identifies the education institution as a registered provider for overseas students ([b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)).\n*   **Legal Responsibility:** It clarifies who is legally responsible for obligations under the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act ([b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)).\n\n### CRICOS Course Code\n\nEach course registered with CRICOS is assigned a unique course code ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)). Some courses may be listed more than once with different CRICOS numbers, indicating variations in course length, cost, or entrance requirements ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n\n**Importance of the Course Code:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** It ensures that education agents and prospective students refer to the correct course information ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n*   **Differentiation:** It distinguishes between similar courses that may have different attributes ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n\n## Analysis of CRICOS Codes\n\nBased on the information available, the following points can be established:\n\n### Uniqueness of Codes\n\n*   **Provider Code:** Each institution has a unique provider code that remains constant for that institution ([b5-1-cricos-provider-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-1-cricos-provider-code/)).\n*   **Course Code:** Each course has a unique course code. Even within the same institution, different courses will have different codes ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n\n### Variability of Course Codes\n\nThe course code is not the same for every course offered by an education provider. It varies depending on several factors:\n\n*   **Course Content:** Different courses, such as a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science, will have different codes.\n*   **Course Length:** Variations in course duration will result in different codes ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n*   **Entrance Requirements:** Courses with different entry criteria will have different codes ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n*   **Delivery Mode:** Courses offered online, on-campus, or in a blended format may have different CRICOS codes ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/cricos-course-codes-your-key-to-high-quality-international-education-in-australia)).\n*   **Campus Location:** The same course offered at different campuses may have different codes ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/cricos-course-codes-your-key-to-high-quality-international-education-in-australia)).\n\n### Importance for International Students\n\nCRICOS registration is essential for international students for several reasons:\n\n*   **Visa Requirements:** Enrolment in a CRICOS-registered course is a prerequisite for obtaining an Australian student visa ([b2-3-cricos.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-3-cricos/)).\n*   **Quality Assurance:** CRICOS registration ensures that the course meets national standards and is recognized by the Australian government ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/cricos-course-codes-your-key-to-high-quality-international-education-in-australia)).\n*   **Support Services:** Institutions registered with CRICOS are required to provide adequate support services to help international students adjust to life in Australia ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)).\n\n### Searching for Information on CRICOS\n\nCRICOS provides an online database that allows users to search for institutions and courses. The search can be refined by:\n\n*   **Institution Location:** Searching for providers in a specific state or territory ([b5-4-institution-search.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-4-institution-search)).\n*   **Institution Name:** Searching for institutions with specific keywords in their name ([b5-4-institution-search.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-4-institution-search)).\n*   **Type of Course:** Specifying the level of study, such as Bachelor Degree ([b5-3-course-search.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-3-course-search)).\n*   **Field of Education:** Selecting a broad field of study, such as Health ([b5-3-course-search.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-3-course-search)).\n\n### Responsibilities of Registered Providers\n\nRegistered providers have several responsibilities under the National Code of Practice, including:\n\n*   **Compliance:** Meeting the requirements for CRICOS registration and ensuring that the ESOS agency has up-to-date information ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards)).\n*   **Complaints and Appeals:** Ensuring that overseas students have access to fair and documented complaints and appeals processes ([b4-1-national-code-standards.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-1-national-code-standards)).\n*   **Accurate Information:** Providing accurate information about the level and field of study for each course, aligning with the Australian Qualifications Framework and the Australian Standard Classification of Education ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/new-esos-regulations-for-cricos-registered-providers)).\n\n### Education Agents and CRICOS\n\nEducation agents play a crucial role in assisting students with their study plans. They must:\n\n*   **Verify CRICOS Registration:** Ensure that the institutions and courses they recommend are registered with CRICOS ([themigration.com.au](https://themigration.com.au/blog/cricos-code-australia-a-comprehensive-guide/)).\n*   **Provide Accurate Information:** Use the correct CRICOS course code when discussing courses with prospective students ([b5-2-cricos-course-code.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)).\n*   **Avoid Misleading Conduct:** Not engage in false or misleading conduct and declare any conflicts of interest ([b4-2-responsibilities-of-registered-providers-to-education-agents.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b4-2-responsibilities-of-registered-providers-to-education-agents)).\n*   **Forbidden Actions:** Agents are prohibited from offering courses not registered on CRICOS to students seeking a student visa ([b2-3-cricos.md](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b2-3-cricos/)).\n\n### National Code of Practice\n\nThe National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 provides nationally consistent standards for registered CRICOS providers ([ablis.business.gov.au](https://ablis.business.gov.au/service/ag/national-code-of-practice-for-registration-authorities-and-providers-of-education-and-training-to-overseas-students/30928)). The Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) monitors VET and ELICOS providers' compliance with the National Code ([asqa.gov.au](https://www.asqa.gov.au/news-events/news/reminder-cricos-providers-new-national-code-commenced-1-january-2018)).\n\n### Recent Updates and Changes\n\nThe ESOS Regulations were updated in 2019, requiring providers to give detailed information about the level and field of study for each course, aligning with national standards ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/new-esos-regulations-for-cricos-registered-providers)). Providers must notify TEQSA of any changes that could significantly affect their ability to comply with the ESOS Act ([teqsa.gov.au](https://www.teqsa.gov.au/cricos-and-elicos/notifications-and-approvals-required-cricos-registered-providers)).\n\n### Finding a CRICOS CodeFinding a CRICOS code is a straightforward process:\n\n1.  **Visit the CRICOS Website:** Access the official CRICOS website ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/what-is-a-cricos-course-code-and-how-to-find-it/)).\n2.  **Use the Search Function:** Search by course name, institution, or location ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/what-is-a-cricos-course-code-and-how-to-find-it/)).\n3.  **Review the Course Details:** Check the course details, including the CRICOS code, course name, duration, and provider details ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/what-is-a-cricos-course-code-and-how-to-find-it/)).\n4.  **Confirm Visa Eligibility:** Ensure that the course meets the requirements for the intended visa application ([vetresources.com.au](https://vetresources.com.au/blog/what-is-a-cricos-course-code-and-how-to-find-it/)).\n\n### Format of CRICOS Codes\n\nCRICOS course codes typically consist of six digits followed by a letter. The first five digits identify the institution, while the last digit and letter reference the specific course ([caqa.com.au](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/cricos-course-codes-your-key-to-high-quality-international-education-in-australia)). For example, \"123456A\" where \"12345\" represents the institution and \"6A\" represents the course.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the statement that \"the course code will be different for each course that the education provider offers depending on the length and topic of the course. The provider code will always be the same for a certain education provider\" is **correct**. Each institution has a unique and constant provider code, while the course code varies based on course specifics such as content, length, entrance requirements, delivery mode, and campus location. Understanding these codes is crucial for ensuring compliance with Australian regulations and providing accurate information to international students. The CRICOS system plays a vital role in maintaining the quality and integrity of Australia's international education sector.\n\n## References\n\n*   ablis.business.gov.au.
