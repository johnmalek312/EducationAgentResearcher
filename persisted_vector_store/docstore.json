However, there were at least 250 distinct language groups before colonisation, with approximately 700 dialects spoken across 500 different clan groups or \u2018nations\u2019.\r\n\r\nTraditional Aboriginal culture and social organisation depended on a complex system of rules and kinship networks. This is informed by a sophisticated system of beliefs, called the Dreaming, which define the roles and responsibilities of people and their relationships between each other and the land. Such cultural practices are expressed, preserved and passed on through a rich oral tradition.\r\n\r\n_Listen to photographer Wayne Quilliam speak about his work travelling across Australia for 30 years and documenting its hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. (Source: BBC News)_\r\n\r\nThere remains an extensive mix of traditions, spiritualities and customs among today\u2019s Indigenous population. Traditional beliefs and practices vary significantly across different regions and groups. \r\n\r\nHowever, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people generally share a common holistic worldview that emphasises the reciprocal relationship and interconnectedness between people, landforms, animals and other elements of natural landscapes. This philosophy is based on spirituality, ecology and consensual-communal organisation, and involves a custodial relationship to the land that many believe confirms their Indigenous identity.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### 1600s/1700s\r\n\r\nThe European exploration of Australia started in the 1600s, when Dutch explorers visited the northern and western coasts of Australia and discovered Tasmania. The first British explorer to the area was William Dampier, who landed on the northwest coast in 1688.\r\n\r\nIn 1770, James Cook landed on the eastern coast of Australia, naming it \u2018New South Wales\u2019 and claiming the territory for Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEuropean settlement of Australia began in 1788, when Britain established a penal colony on the east coast. British colonisation aimed to use Australia as a base for trade with South East Asia and China, and also relieve the overcrowded prisons in Britain.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arthur Phillip commanded eleven ships full of convicts, military guards and officials, arriving in Australia on January 18, 1788 at Botany Bay. After 8 days, this group of 1,373 people, (including 732 convicts) moved a few kilometres north to Port Jackson. Their settlement here later grew into the city of Sydney.\r\n\r\nAustralia Day (26th of January) is an annual public holiday that commemorates the start of settlement at Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nHowever, colonisation had devastating impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The original population was reduced by approximately 90% as they were exposed to foreign diseases or killed; many were dispossessed from their traditional lands and separated from their cultural identities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### 1800s\r\n\r\nThe colonisation of Australia grew rapidly and expanded across the entire continent. Within the next hundred years, additional colonies were established near present day Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, and Melbourne. Colonists faced difficult conditions in settling in the new environment. A national character of toughness, independence and perseverance emerged.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain sent over a further 160,000 convicts to Australia over the following 80 years. The rise of the wool industry and discovery of gold in the mid-1800s also saw many British and Irish settlers arrive voluntarily. Around 40,000 Chinese immigrants came to Australia in search of gold between 1852 and 1889.\r\n\r\nAustralia\u2019s distance from Europe made British governance over the colonies difficult. The colonists also wanted self-governance, so in 1850 the British Government gave the colonies the power to make their own laws.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4656, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f73e9735-deda-4079-8727-c44e09d12a96": {"__data__": {"id_": "f73e9735-deda-4079-8727-c44e09d12a96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-1-history.md", "file_name": "a2-1-history.md", "file_size": 7126, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6f6ce32-4088-40e2-9ddf-9bd9011f6bf6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-1-history.md", "file_name": "a2-1-history.md", "file_size": 7126, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "9746d8c153c68c56ce3cf607de5810788d1f6bc55e0bd4ea623a28fb4c6cfe57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5e709a1-dae5-4a18-bedb-db1b8f2a77e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-1-history.md", "file_name": "a2-1-history.md", "file_size": 7126, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "7ad153fa6d6805779ff043ac782d41dfa7bfef63712b6273763f5413fdecb3a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### 1800s\r\n\r\nThe colonisation of Australia grew rapidly and expanded across the entire continent.

A national character of toughness, independence and perseverance emerged.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain sent over a further 160,000 convicts to Australia over the following 80 years.

Around 40,000 Chinese immigrants came to Australia in search of gold between 1852 and 1889.\r\n\r\nAustralia\u2019s distance from Europe made British governance over the colonies difficult. The colonists also wanted self-governance, so in 1850 the British Government gave the colonies the power to make their own laws.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 19th century, Australia consisted of six self-governing colonies: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Each colony was a distinct political entity with its own parliament, governor, laws and regulations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### 1900s\r\n\r\nIt was eventually agreed that the colonies needed to join together to protect and promote their common interests. A national government was created on January 1, 1901, an event is known as \u2018Federation\u2019. This produced a united country and resulted in important feelings of pride and patriotism in the Australian public. (You\u2019ll learn more about the Federal Government in 1.5.)\r\n\r\nAustralia faced a national challenge when it entered World War I. Soldiers from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (called the ANZACs) landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey on April 25, 1915. They fought an unsuccessful battle that lasted for 8 months and resulted in 26,111 Australian casualties. However, the fighting and personal qualities of the ANZACs contributed to the national identity and helped to unite the Australian people. Today, ANZAC Day is a national holiday on the 25th of April that commemorates the contributions and sacrifices of all men and women from the armed services.\r\n\r\nAlmost a million Australians served in World War II. The Australian mainland came under direct attack for the first time as Japanese aircrafts bombed Darwin and Japanese submarines attacked Sydney Harbour. Australia\u2019s vulnerability to an invasion influenced a decision to increase its population and encourage the migration of people from about 200 countries.\r\n\r\nIn total, about 7 million people have migrated to Australia since the end of WWII (including displaced people). Their arrival has influenced all aspects of Australian society.\r\n\r\nToday, more than one in four Australians were born overseas. New Zealand and United Kingdom have been the largest source countries for migrants. More recently, immigration from Asian countries such as China and India have become more significant.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A2.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a2-australia/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a2-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3751, "end_char_idx": 7096, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ded5e0-4154-4b12-9af0-37c43f1d1817": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ded5e0-4154-4b12-9af0-37c43f1d1817", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-2-population-and-culture.md", "file_name": "a2-2-population-and-culture.md", "file_size": 5408, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "172fc926-c058-4cb6-8bed-89b40f9b6bb0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-2-population-and-culture.md", "file_name": "a2-2-population-and-culture.md", "file_size": 5408, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "83fb4372bde3f445acc6b14b72ed88702f1ddd85433fb72f16453fd194fb37a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac2f5a7b-4525-4371-b54d-93c73c5904ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89f1780104da787b43c6f79159157b8a891c16779a07b48222cd2beda1b557de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a2-2-population-and-culture/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a2-australia\r\ntopic_slug: a2-2-population-and-culture\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A2.2 Population and Culture\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A2.

The major reason for this is related to its geological history. Initially, Australia was part of a larger continent but about 40 million years ago it separated fully and became an isolated continent.\r\n\r\nAfter this separation, marsupial mammals best adapted to the Australian environment and eventually dominated it. Australia is one of the few places on Earth to have such a large number of marsupials, and to have the only two monotreme mammals. These two types of [fauna](http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/fauna/index.htm) can be explained as follows:\r\n\r\n  * Marsupial mammals give birth to their young and carry them in a pouch.  \r\nExamples \u2013 Kangaroo, Koala, Wombat.\r\n  * Monotreme mammals lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.  \r\nExamples \u2013 Platypus, Echidna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-pixabay-85678-1024x666.jpg)_Koalas_\r\n\r\nDespite its long history, Australia\u2019s biodiversity has changed dramatically in the last 200 years. Since European settlement, many ecosystems have been radically simplified and fragmented. Also, many plants and animals have been introduced from around the world, and they have had serious environmental consequences. An example of this is the [cane toad](http://australianmuseum.net.au/Cane-Toad).  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Natural Wonders\r\n\r\nAustralia is an island continent and its landscape consists mainly of low plateaus, which are sectioned off by several rugged mountain ranges. The [Great Dividing Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range) is the longest mountain range that starts in central Victoria and ends in Northern Queensland and is several thousand kilometres in length.\r\n\r\nThe landscape in the tropical north consists of rainforest that leads into large areas of grasslands. These eventually merge into the central deserts, which are the largest in the world outside of the Sahara. This part of Australia is called the Red Centre, because of the unusual red colour of its sand.\r\n\r\nThree unique natural wonders are described here:\r\n\r\n#### 1\\.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2650, "end_char_idx": 6069, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a39e41d-3eee-42fa-9b1e-0801f531046f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a39e41d-3eee-42fa-9b1e-0801f531046f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_name": "a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_size": 8821, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f6aa95e-c164-4ac9-b802-a6e5c157e310", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_name": "a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_size": 8821, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "e18d3bc845992692e38443d24c4853f80014c80e29446131b4dda181bde79482", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e40305d0-9308-400d-9a60-aad320e358c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_name": "a2-3-climate-and-environment.md", "file_size": 8821, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "43088e76f7e0ee5eed0c8330ed680dbc1c8ec3d71c24c55a2455265f955cc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "An example of this is the [cane toad](http://australianmuseum.net.au/Cane-Toad).  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Natural Wonders\r\n\r\nAustralia is an island continent and its landscape consists mainly of low plateaus, which are sectioned off by several rugged mountain ranges.

It runs from north of [Fraser Island](http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/fraser/index.html) to the tip of [Cape York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York_Peninsula) and provides habitats for many forms of marine life.\r\n\r\nThe Reef is a scuba divers paradise with 2,900 individual reefs, 71 coral islands, 350 different species of coral, and over 1,500 species of fish. Also, it provides a major breeding ground for humpback whales and a feeding ground for endangered species such as dugongs and turtles.\r\n\r\n#### 2\\. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/photoholgic-1GFUOji-yck-unsplash-1024x708.jpg)_Ayers Rock, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park_\r\n\r\n[Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park](http://www.parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/) covers 132,566 hectares close to the centre of Australia and is owned by the Anangu Aboriginal people. It contains a range of remarkable geological and landform features including the spectacular monoliths of Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas).\r\n\r\nThe park is co-managed by Parks Australia and the Anangu people. Uluru has been the focus of religious, cultural, territorial and economic inter-relations among the Aboriginal peoples of the Western Desert for thousands of years. It is 340 metres high and has a circumference of 9.4 kilometres.\r\n\r\nKata Tjuta means \u2018many heads\u2019 and rock formations consist of 36 steep-sided domes. Mount Olga is its highest peak at 500 metres high.\r\n\r\n#### 3\\. Tasmanian Wilderness\r\n\r\nThe island state of Tasmania is separated from mainland Australia. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area is one of the largest conservation reserves in Australia. It covers about 20 per cent of Tasmania (1.38 million hectares), and it is one of only three temperate wilderness areas remaining in the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis area contains rocks of every geological period and is a major centre for plant diversity. Its Huon pines, which can be up to 2000 years old, are some of the oldest trees in the world. Also, several animals that are now extinct on mainland Australia still survive there.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A2.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-3-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-2-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a2-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-3-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5226, "end_char_idx": 8789, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60fcb00c-fa81-4f1b-8bf7-aa45ce1ada33": {"__data__": {"id_": "60fcb00c-fa81-4f1b-8bf7-aa45ce1ada33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-4-geography.md", "file_name": "a2-4-geography.md", "file_size": 9095, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8e36d9d5-7a0a-4197-97be-d118663a5c81", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-4-geography.md", "file_name": "a2-4-geography.md", "file_size": 9095, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c2f7e345cf3b0026a4bc5ccf695421a115204e9c1331184322ae2fa4908bfc24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83f44a0a-c302-48f9-a346-5a5bc3be21c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67e703ec1295d3238872843aaeff72b0dd57e62b2deecb6fa600093e70cfd64a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a2-4-geography/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a2-australia\r\ntopic_slug: a2-4-geography\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A2.4 Geography\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A2.

It is based on:\r\n\r\n  * freedom of speech and association,\r\n  * religious tolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralia\u2019s written constitution outlines all government activities. For example, the federal government is responsible for foreign relations and trade, defence and immigration. Other aspects of governance are shared between the States and the Federal Government. In particular, Federal and State governments cooperate in administering the laws that govern education.\r\n\r\nThe Australian government is based on a popularly elected Parliament with two chambers, the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). The party that holds the majority of seats in the House of Representatives forms the government. However, minority parties often hold the balance of power in the Senate, which serves to review the decisions of the government.\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministers are appointed from the Lower House and Upper House to conduct executive government. Policy decisions are made in Cabinet meetings.\r\n\r\nVoting in Australia is compulsory and about 90% of voters participate in federal elections. Elections usually occur every 2.5 to 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government\u2019s leader is called the Prime Minister. Currently, the main political parties and people involved in the federal government are summarised here:\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT| OPPOSITION  \r\n---|---  \r\n[Prime Minister](http://www.pm.gov.au/)  \r\nThe Hon. Anthony Albanese  \r\n\u2013 a member of the [Australian Labor Party](http://www.alp.org.au/)| Leader of the Opposition  \r\nMr Peter Dutton  \r\na member of the [Liberal Party of Australia](https://www.liberal.org.au/)  \r\nDeputy Prime Minister  \r\n\u2013 The Hon.

The King accepts the advice of the elected Australian Government to appoint a Governor-General, who represents him. The Governor-General has wide powers but by convention acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister. In the States, the King is represented by State Governors.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### State\r\n\r\nEach State and Territory has its own democratically elected government and leader:\r\n\r\n  * the State Government leader is called the Premier,\r\n  * the Territory leader is called the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState parliaments are subject to the national Constitution as well as their State constitutions. In practice, the federal and state governments cooperate in many areas such as education, transport, health, and law enforcement.\r\n\r\n### Local\r\n\r\nLocal government councils control the urban and rural areas, taking care of issues such as local transport, rubbish collection and town planning. Local councils are active in providing services such as libraries, childcare services as well as activities and events. Local councils also promote their regions as study and tourist destinations, so they sometimes have interaction with education agents. The leader of a council is called the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A2.5 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-5-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-4-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a2-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a2-5-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4466, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "545737fb-bb3f-4f1d-ad75-92c427766e11": {"__data__": {"id_": "545737fb-bb3f-4f1d-ad75-92c427766e11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-australia.md", "file_name": "a2-australia.md", "file_size": 2700, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efb10299-224a-4f78-9ec3-7f857d3f0f23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a2-australia\\a2-australia.md", "file_name": "a2-australia.md", "file_size": 2700, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "ec72f8a77e06d538c6d04e3c1424fff0a2635ee5b83c1861a7c87ddac641bb7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a2-australia/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: a2-australia\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A2.

Both public schools and private schools exist in each state. The curriculum taught in each state or school may vary but the learning areas are the same in all.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about each State and Territory\u2019s education system by viewing their web sites below:  \r\n  \r\n[Australian Capital Territory Department of Education and Training](http://www.det.act.gov.au/)  \r\n[New South Wales Department of Education and Training](https://education.nsw.gov.au/)  \r\n[Australian Government Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/)  \r\n[Education Queensland](http://education.qld.gov.au/)  \r\n[South Australia Department of Education and Children\u2019s Services](https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/about-sa/government/departments/education)  \r\n[Tasmania Department of Education](http://www.education.tas.gov.au/)  \r\n[Victoria Department of Education and Training](http://www.education.vic.gov.au/)  \r\n[Western Australia Department of Education and Training](https://www.education.wa.edu.au/)\r\n\r\n**Vocational Education and Training**\r\n\r\nAustralia has a Vocational Education and Training (VET) system. VET prepares people for work in a career that does not need a university degree. the national body [ASQA](http://www.asqa.gov.au/) regulates and manages the system and ensures consistent national standards. Typically, a VET course takes up to two years of study.\r\n\r\nIn the workplace, employers use agreed courses and outcomes to set standards of training for employment. Many parts of industry and business provide ongoing workplace training for their employees. Some of this training can count towards a qualification. People who are educated overseas can gain recognition of their training which may help them to get employment.\r\n\r\n**Higher Education**\r\n\r\nThe national government provides the funding for universities in all the states. While each university is independent in its governance and can decide on which courses they want to offer and the course content, they are regulated by [TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/). Typically, a university course takes three or four years of study.\r\n\r\n### Participation of Australians in education\r\n\r\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes information about the participation of Australia residents in education. Participation in education beyond compulsory schooling is encouraged.\r\n\r\nFor the nation, having a skilled work force is vital in supporting ongoing economic development and improving living conditions.,\r\n\r\nIn 2020-21, 42% of Australians aged 15-74 years had participated in learning over the past 12 months (7.8 million people). You can access specific data about participation in education [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/education/work-related-training-and-adult-learning-australia/2020-21). \r\n\r\nIt is compulsory for all Australian students to attend school until Year 10 or age 16.\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a3-australian-education/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a3-australian-education/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Topic ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3839, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0440a6ed-dc72-49a3-aa23-9b9545fddeb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0440a6ed-dc72-49a3-aa23-9b9545fddeb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md", "file_name": "a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md", "file_size": 2665, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21ad6972-e247-406a-a0d6-1530f4cc8a1f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md", "file_name": "a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf.md", "file_size": 2665, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "187d7e3a140db76f90d9f607865b7c3d74010d9e352de599d6f2a11a6c4de58c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a3-australian-education\r\ntopic_slug: a3-2-the-australian-qualifications-framework-aqf\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A3.2 The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF)\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A3.

These programs have a variety of names but they all provide entry into another course of a higher level. Australian government analysis of education pathways that international students take can be found [here](https://www.education.gov.au/international-data/data-visualisation-education-pathways).\r\n\r\nThere are four types of pathway programs that are designed for and are popular with international students:\r\n\r\n**PATHWAY PROGRAM**| **PURPOSE**  \r\n---|---  \r\nEnglish language courses (ELICOS) \u2013 see A.4| As a route to all levels of qualifications on the AQF  \r\nFoundation Programs| As a route to undergraduate and VET courses  \r\nDiploma Programs| As a route to undergraduate courses  \r\nOther Bridging Courses| As a route to all levels of qualifications on the AQF  \r\n  \r\n### Foundation Programs\r\n\r\nFoundation programs (also known as Foundation Years or University Preparation courses) take many forms but they offer an alternative means for international students to access post-school institutions. They are most commonly used as a pathway for students who do not meet the entry requirements of an undergraduate Bachelor degree program. Such programs are offered by institutions in the School, VET, ELICOS and Higher Education sectors.\r\n\r\nFoundation programs may:\r\n\r\n  * be offered by private institutions for a particular university,\r\n  * offer formal qualifications (normally a Certificate IV),\r\n  * not offer a formal qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specifically, Foundation programs tend to:\r\n\r\n  * contain academic based subjects,\r\n  * focus on English language development,\r\n  * have minimum entry requirements of successful completion of Year 11 (or equivalent) and an of IELTS score of 5.5 (or equivalent scores of other acceptable language tests like TOEFL, Cambridge CAE or PTE),\r\n  * be of a comparable academic standard to an Australian Year 12 secondary school qualification,\r\n  * normally be one academic year in length,\r\n  * often guarantee entry to a particular university course if the student meets the required standards,\r\n  * not offer credit in the subsequent program of study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome foundation programs are shorter than one year (commonly called \u2018express\u2019 or \u2018accelerated\u2019 programs) and are typically offered to students who have completed Year 12 and have an IELTS score of 6.0 (or equivalent scores of TOEFL, CAE, PTE or other ways of satisfying the provider _*_).\r\n\r\n_*this depends on the education provider, you need to check with them for specific language requirements._\r\n\r\nSome foundation programs allow students to undertake a longer program than normal with extra English language development. These are often called \u2018extended\u2019 programs and are for students who have a lower English level (typically IELTS 5.0, TOEFL Paper 500, TOEFL iBT 64 or TOEFL Computer 180).\r\n\r\n### How are foundation programs different from secondary school Year 12 programs?\r\n\r\nFoundation programs are functionally the same as Australian Year 12 secondary school programs and provide for a similar level of academic work.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4084, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ce063bd-2f0f-4742-be7a-d3a08136f98b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ce063bd-2f0f-4742-be7a-d3a08136f98b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_name": "a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_size": 12178, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdf32f6-6aa1-47c2-9a7c-e08b84cb5dc5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_name": "a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_size": 12178, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "22eddbd07a95e1b895da3103d7c1ff9cd4e99d64c56d45932b27dc5b68bafa22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2794a8e5-80ff-48e1-836b-e8e5b90d4965", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_name": "a3-3-pathways-for-international-students.md", "file_size": 12178, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "588540ce6b8ce6c177135da7a96e42a1d0bfe2e32d5684bfd9f53b177e2f558f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2293a8e5-2a60-426c-b149-9ee5a37ec631", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6dccafeb3123ae2cabca36106a7eaf4809080458d386d7c2bc512f46f914752", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "_*this depends on the education provider, you need to check with them for specific language requirements._\r\n\r\nSome foundation programs allow students to undertake a longer program than normal with extra English language development.

But there are key differences between these two types of courses:\r\n\r\n**FOUNDATION PROGRAMS**| **YEAR 12 PROGRAMS**  \r\n---|---  \r\n\u2013 their results are accepted by those institutions with prior arrangements and may guarantee a place in an undergraduate program to a student| \u2013 their results are accepted by all Australian higher education institutions  \r\n\u2013 they are typically provided for international students alone| \u2013 international students typically study alongside Australian students in most classes  \r\n\u2013 they are often packaged with the undergraduate program the student wishes to study| \u2013 they are not packaged with an undergraduate program  \r\n\u2013 they are designed for international students who wish to go in to higher education| \u2013 they are designed to meet the needs of Australian students who may seek a variety of outcomes  \r\n\u2013 they develop the student\u2019s academic English, communication and cultural awareness skills| \u2013 they may not directly develop these skills  \r\n\u2013 they focus on the subjects typically taken by international students at an undergraduate level| \u2013 they have a wider range of subject choices for students  \r\n\u2013 they often focus on the delivery of higher education learning such as lectures and tutorials| \u2013 they normally focus on classroom learning  \r\n\u2013 they are typically delivered in an adult college environment| \u2013 they are mostly delivered in a school setting (e.g. regarding uniforms, extra-curricular activities, and school camps)  \r\n\u2013 their students are usually aged from 17 to early 20s, with some \u2018mature-age students\u2019| \u2013 their students are typically aged from 16 to 18  \r\n\u2013 if the program is linked to a university, the students commonly have use of the university\u2019s facilities, the university\u2019s academic staff have input into the program, and the university tracks the performance of ex-foundation students in undergraduate programs| \u2013 they are designed by State education authorities  \r\n  \r\n### Recognition of Foundation programs\r\n\r\nThe recognition of a foundation program by universities can vary greatly. Many universities guarantee entry to students undertaking their endorsed program but only recognise other foundation programs on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the Group of 8 ([Go8](https://go8.edu.au/)) foundation programs are more widely accepted and are likely to provide entry into most Australian universities. However, other programs may have difficulty in providing entry into the Go8 Universities, except for their highest achieving students.\r\n\r\n**As an agent, you must be ensure that any student intending to take a foundation program understands which universities or higher education providers accept that program.**\r\n\r\n### Diploma Programs\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll look at Diploma programs in more detail in section A6 relating to Vocational Education and Training (VET), as they are commonly part of that sector.\r\n\r\nHowever, international students often take Diploma courses principally as a pathway to an undergraduate program rather than for the Diploma qualification itself. Business or Information Technology courses tend to be the most popular fields of study.\r\n\r\nThese courses are promoted by TAFE, private colleges and higher education institutions providing entry to undergraduate programs, and are packaged with undergraduate courses. For example, a student who successfully completes the Diploma will typically gain entry into the second year of an undergraduate Business degree.\r\n\r\nIn this way, these courses provide a pathway into undergraduate programs for students who would otherwise not meet the entry requirements of the undergraduate program.\r\n\r\nThey are marketed as competitors to foundation programs and in many cases accept students from similar educational backgrounds. In some cases, students may undertake a foundation program in order to access a Diploma and then an undergraduate program.\r\n\r\n### How are Diploma Programs different from Foundation Programs?\r\n\r\nUniversities offer credit to students who have completed a Diploma program.

Even though Diploma courses are longer than foundation programs, this credit allows Diploma students to complete their studies in a shorter time than if they undertake a foundation program and then an undergraduate course.\r\n\r\nThere are a few further differences as outlined below:\r\n\r\n**DIPLOMA PROGRAMS**| **FOUNDATION PROGRAMS**  \r\n---|---  \r\n\u2013 they always provide a qualification| \u2013 not all of them provide a qualification  \r\n\u2013 they have a more limited subject base than foundation programs, so there are fewer options for further study. Typically, they provide entry to Business and IT courses| \u2013 they often provide entry into a wide range of undergraduate courses offered at their partner university  \r\n\u2013 the most prestigious Australian universities typically do not provide much credit (if any) to on-shore Diploma programs. This makes Diploma programs less beneficial or attractive for students who wish to enter these universities. The most prestigious Universities often do not support a Diploma partnership as a mechanism for entry into their undergraduate programs| \u2013 the most prestigious universities prefer to endorse foundation programs as their preferred pathway  \r\n  \r\nDiploma programs are a key pathway for international students. Universities that promote Diploma programs may also have a foundation pathway available to students. This option may be useful for students intending to take non-Business or IT courses, or as an entry path to the Diploma itself.\r\n\r\n### On-shore and Off-shore Programs\r\n\r\nDiploma programs are be offered both in Australia (on-shore) or off-shore through an off-shore campus or a partnership. This means that an Australian Diploma is offered by another provider overseas.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, an overseas Diploma that is not accredited by any Australian authority can form a similar pathway to undergraduate programs. For example, it can provide entry into the second or even third year of an undergraduate program. These arrangements are particularly common in respect to Diplomas offered by colleges and polytechnics in Singapore and Malaysia. Also, the word \u2018Diploma\u2019 may be used to refer to different course levels in different countries.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, overseas Diplomas are more widely accepted by Australian universities than local Diplomas. All Go8 Universities provide credit arrangements to some overseas Diplomas even if they do not do this for Australian Diplomas.\r\n\r\n### Other Bridging Courses\r\n\r\nAustralian institutions offer a large number of bridging and short courses, which are not similar to foundation or Diploma programs. It is difficult to categorise them because they are typically designed to support entry into a particular program at a particular institution. Also, they may have limited portability and recognition by other institutions.\r\n\r\nSome general features of bridging courses are:\r\n\r\n  * they vary greatly in length from 5 weeks or more, but usually shorter in duration than foundation or Diploma courses\r\n  * they are commonly non-award\r\n  * they can be non-essential. This means they offer the attainment of skills, which may be of use to a prospective student in a further course but which they do not formally need to enter the principal program\r\n  * they may allow a student to attain a single pre-requisite subject which is necessary for further study\r\n  * they may provide an alternative means of improving English proficiency in an environment specific to a single discipline\r\n  * they may provide entry to particular postgraduate courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A3.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a3-3-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a3-2-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a3-australian-education/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a3-3-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7695, "end_char_idx": 12094, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20d8bd46-aa7b-4fb2-8a0e-283833618808": {"__data__": {"id_": "20d8bd46-aa7b-4fb2-8a0e-283833618808", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-australian-education.md", "file_name": "a3-australian-education.md", "file_size": 2028, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0ccb14e-1cda-4162-9f43-51e1c7884bad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a3-australian-education\\a3-australian-education.md", "file_name": "a3-australian-education.md", "file_size": 2028, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c2e42f35d19302eb7fe28cc941b96fda82fe8b7566999acf004b06e0550dbebd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a3-australian-education/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: a3-australian-education\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A3.

This helps each child reach their full intellectual and educational potential. Study programs are child-centred and focus on the development of learning skills and strategies, which trains students to be life-long, self-motivated learners.\r\n\r\nAustralian schools usually have a number of characteristics:\r\n\r\n**The teacher\u2019s role**|  The teacher aims to assist students in reaching their individual learning goals.  \r\n---|---  \r\n**Class activities**|  Students commonly undertake projects, group work and self-directed learning.  \r\n**Dress codes**|  Most schools enforce dress codes or have a uniform to promote a sense of equality and to maintain a focus on education instead of fashion.  \r\n**Class sizes**|  These are kept as small as possible so that teachers can regularly interact with students on an individual basis.  \r\n**School hours**|  Schools operate from 9am to 3pm, Monday to Friday. Before-school and after-school care is generally available to those students who require it.  \r\n**Teacher training**|  All Australian teachers in secondary education and above are required to be university trained***** , with secondary school teachers having specialist qualifications in their subject area.  \r\n**Special programs & services**| These are available for:  \r\n\u2013 gifted students  \r\n\u2013 students with disabilities  \r\nto help them reach their fullest potential.  \r\n**English support**|  International students often have access to English language support to help them adapt to their new school environment.  \r\n  \r\n***** There may be teachers in the current education system who aren\u2019t university trained as they may have started teaching before this prerequisite was put into place.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A4.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a4-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a4-australian-schools/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a4-australian-schools/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a4-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4259, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e77fa89-41f7-49d3-894e-933c80cc86a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e77fa89-41f7-49d3-894e-933c80cc86a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a4-australian-schools\\a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md", "file_name": "a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md", "file_size": 5276, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e96dd006-be9d-4590-b116-b4e4fe953b73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a4-australian-schools\\a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md", "file_name": "a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling.md", "file_size": 5276, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "718fe5a1480031ecd1931cb65d41e906dff94062c70fade93f9391aee1908311", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd487122-ee1c-409d-925e-c16c2b579870", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d07bd734e08ce6c655fb25930f2b0d8a761bf8fb4df53487956aeed51b937de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a4-australian-schools\r\ntopic_slug: a4-2-structure-of-australian-schooling\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A4.2 Structure of Australian Schooling\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A4.

Also, some unaccompanied primary age children study in Australia on student visas._  \r\n  \r\n\u2013 This level is compulsory for all students.  \r\n\u2013 There is no entrance examination for public primary schools.  \r\n\u2013 Co-educational and single-sex schools exist.  \r\n\u2013 Students learn with others of a similar age.  \r\n\u2013 Learning occurs by group and individual activities.  \r\n\u2013 There is one teacher in each class for all subjects except for some specialist subjects (e.g. Art).  \r\n\u2013 There is no standardised exam at the end of primary school.  \r\n\u2013 Students do not receive a formal certificate after completing primary school.  \r\n  \r\nThe early part of children\u2019s education is very important since it is in these formative years that attitudes and behaviour begins to take shape. Emphasis is put not only on the educational side of primary schooling, but also on students developing communication and co-operation skills, which will serve them well in later life.  \r\n**Secondary School**  \r\n  \r\nDuration: 5-6 years  \r\n  \r\nAge: 12-18 years old|  _To enter secondary school, international students must provide their academic records and demonstrate appropriate English proficiency._  \r\n  \r\n**General Information**  \r\n\u2013 The general tone of secondary education is much more independent and student guided than primary school.

For the most  \r\ncurrent international student statistics, you can access updated data on the Australian Government\u2019s  \r\neducation website.\r\n\r\nAustralian school education offers the opportunity for students to develop life skills in a positive and outgoing environment. Importance is given to personal development as well as academic studies.\r\n\r\nSchools in Australia take great care in looking after their international students, helping them to adjust to the Australian way of life. The multicultural nature of Australian society means international students are readily accepted by other students. Teachers are experienced in teaching classes to students from many different countries and cultures.\r\n\r\nSome schools and colleges cater exclusively for international students, whereas others have long traditions of student exchange with other international schools. In many cases students are able to maintain and develop their own language skills as well as become proficient in the English language.\r\n\r\nThere are three primary reasons that international students are attracted to studying in Australia:\r\n\r\n  * Quality\r\n  * English as a Second Language (ESL) Programs\r\n  * Information and Communication Technology in Schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quality\r\n\r\nState and Territory Governments have agreed on a National Curriculum Framework for all Australian schools, that outlines national standards in key learning areas. This framework ensures that all students in Australian schools achieve the best possible outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe National Curriculum Framework is based on ten common and agreed national goals for schooling. The goals identify the skills, understanding, knowledge, attitudes and values which should be developed in young Australians. They focus on eight learning areas:\r\n\r\n  * English\r\n  * Mathematics\r\n  * Science\r\n  * Technology\r\n  * Studies of Society and the Environment\r\n  * Health and Physical Education\r\n  * Languages other than English and\r\n  * Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Comparisons with other countries\r\n\r\nThe latest PISA insights and interpretations showed that Australian students were above OECD averages in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy. The full detailed report of its findings can be found [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/PISA%202018%20Insights%20and%20Interpretations%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf).\r\n\r\n### English as a Second Language (ESL) Programs\r\n\r\nESL programs in both primary and high schools are available for students whose first language is not English. The types of ESL students range from those newly arrived in Australia and beginning to learn English to Australian-born students from a non-English speaking background.\r\n\r\nIn general, ESL support can:\r\n\r\n  * prepare students for entry into school studies in intensive English courses,\r\n  * provide ongoing language-support programs for students after they begin their formal studies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParents of international students have access to translation and interpreter services in the public school system.\r\n\r\n### Information and Communication Technology in Schools\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-yan-krukov-8199759-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nAustralian schools aim to produce graduates who are able to use information and communication technology (ICT) effectively in all aspects of their lives.

These centres are completely focused on the needs of international students, so they have highly developed support services for such students. \r\n\r\nEnglish language training is often the first type of course an international student may undertake in Australia so ELICOS colleges have well-developed reception, orientation and accommodation placement processes to reflect this fact.\r\n\r\nELICOS students typically come on a student visa, a tourist visa or a working holiday visa. People on a tourist visa are only permitted to study for a maximum of three months and those on working holiday visas for a maximum of four months. Individuals wishing to study in Australia for longer than this should apply for a student visa.\r\n\r\nThose ELICOS students who hold a student visa are covered by the ESOS Act (see B3). However students on tourist visas, working holiday or other visas are not covered by the ESOS Act.\r\n\r\nELICOS courses can be taken by students as stand-alone courses. In this case a student may wish to improve their English proficiency and then return to their home country. According to previous trends, around 40% of students use the language course as the first in a pathway of courses leading to formal qualifications in the other sectors.\r\n\r\n### Types of ELICOS centres\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 250 accredited ELICOS centres across Australia, and many different types, including:\r\n\r\n  * those located in all of Australia\u2019s major cities as well as in a range of regional locations\r\n  * those which are private or government operated\r\n  * those which are independent or attached to a high school, TAFE college or university\r\n  * small boutique colleges or large international providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A5.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a5-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a5-elicos/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a5-elicos/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a5-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2931, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c99fb4e-d539-4928-aa9a-e91a7db0c5a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c99fb4e-d539-4928-aa9a-e91a7db0c5a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a5-elicos\\a5-2-types-of-courses.md", "file_name": "a5-2-types-of-courses.md", "file_size": 8770, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b60ccb6b-dc95-4a95-af6e-6d5397a33846", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a5-elicos\\a5-2-types-of-courses.md", "file_name": "a5-2-types-of-courses.md", "file_size": 8770, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "6c5e1c6b3cfc2f1b0d0953511b27e84ad03227d329b76ef8434991e002cf8cbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2588751-8661-4924-984b-6590b2052b9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d542afab77c25dfccec3c292bd2401b515d34a180b9176123500d63948a1d4a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-2-types-of-courses/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a5-elicos\r\ntopic_slug: a5-2-types-of-courses\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A5.2 Types of Courses\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A5.

This specifies the minimum qualifications of teachers, class sizes, types of facilities, and the number of study hours per week.\r\n\r\nELICOS courses are accredited by either [TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/) or [ASQA](http://www.asqa.gov.au/) as non-award courses outside of the AQF. However, a small number of courses are accredited as VET courses on the AQF. The nature of the accreditation body should not influence the quality of the educational experience for the student.\r\n\r\nAustralia offers a wide range of ELICOS courses designed to meet the varying needs of students with different reasons for learning English. Full-time ELICOS courses tend to have these features:\r\n\r\n  * Their duration generally ranges from 4 to 48 weeks,\r\n  * They are taught at all levels of proficiency from beginners to advanced.\r\n  * They comprise of at least 20 hours of study each week.\r\n  * They usually have flexible commencement dates, so students can enrol at any time during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOften ELICOS courses are taken in sequence with formal courses of study in other sectors. They are packaged together with one or more courses. Sometimes these further courses are offered at the same institution.\r\n\r\nThere are five major categories of English language courses generally offered in Australia to international students:\r\n\r\n  1. General English\r\n  2. English for Academic Purposes (EAP)\r\n  3. Secondary School Preparation\r\n  4. Examination Preparation\r\n  5. English for Specific Purposes (ESP)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, some ELICOS centres have developed and deliver specific courses to suit the needs of particular clients; for example, courses that may concentrate on executive English, corporate ELICOS training or Study Tour Programs (these programs usually combine English language study with other activities e.g. travelling or sporting activities).\r\n\r\n### 1\\. General English\r\n\r\nThese courses help improve English skills in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students can enter at any level, from elementary to advanced, and they progress at their own pace.\r\n\r\nStudents are generally tested and placed in an appropriate class level at the start of their studies. Classes at each level focus on everyday English, and often include a variety of activities.\r\n\r\nGeneral English is suitable for individuals or for holiday groups and as preparation for the English for Academic Purposes courses.\r\n\r\n### 2\\. English for Academic Purposes (EAP)\r\n\r\nEAP courses are designed to help students succeed in university studies by improving their English and academic study skills. They help students achieve the level of English language proficiency needed to undertake tertiary studies at Australian and International universities (usually around IELTS 6.0 to 6.5 or TOEFL Paper 530 to 570 or other equivalent language tests).

Examination Preparation\r\n\r\nWhile not offering formal qualifications, many English courses focus on preparing students for external English proficiency examinations such as:\r\n\r\n  * [Cambridge exams](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/why-choose-us/study-abroad/australia/) (PET, FCE, CAE, CPE, & BEC), which are the most popular,\r\n  * [the IELTS exam](http://www.ielts.org/),\r\n  * [the TOEFL exam](http://www.ets.org/toefl),\r\n  * [the TOEIC test](http://www.ets.org/toeic).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese courses are generally provided for students aged 17 and above and involve intensive test practice. They cater to people who wish to:\r\n\r\n  * enter educational institutions\r\n  * work in English-speaking countries and\r\n  * obtain a qualification that is valued by employers in their home country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5\\. English for Specific Purposes\r\n\r\nThese courses are generally specialised to meet a specific student need for technical English proficiency. They are often designed specifically for a small student group with similar needs. Courses that are less than 13 weeks in length are often taken while on a tourist visa.\r\n\r\nThis category also includes \u201cBusiness English\u201d courses that are designed for adults seeking job specific English language training. Generally the courses are intensive and focus on improving students\u2019 use of English in the workplace. Most programs expect students to arrive with strong general English skills, and generally start at intermediate and move through advanced levels.\r\n\r\n### 6\\. Short Courses for non-student visa holders\r\n\r\nStudents may obtain a tourist visa to study English for less than 3 months , or if on a working holiday visa, study a maximum of 4 months. These students may undertake the same programs and classes as student visa holders. Note that students studying for less than four months can still apply for a student visa if they wish to.\r\n\r\nIf the students come as a group, then they can have a specific program tailored for them. This is usually known as a \u2018study tour\u2019.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-william-fortunato-6141086-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nStudy tours usually have these features:\r\n\r\n  * They are designed for students studying in their own country either in High School or in Higher Education and take place during holiday periods.\r\n  * They combine tourist or specialised activities with English study.\r\n  * They are often structured around a particular group of students coming from one source overseas (a school, university or workplace).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy Tours are not covered by the ESOS Act nor the National Code. This means that they do not need to meet any specified requirements in terms of hours of study, teacher qualifications or facilities.\r\n\r\nEnglish Colleges that are members of [English Australia](http://www.englishaustralia.com.au/) must conform to best practice guidelines when offering study tours.

IELTS (International English Language Testing System)\r\n\r\n[IELTS](http://www.ielts.org/) is the most commonly used English Proficiency test in Australia and is accepted by all our academic institutions. Also, US academic institutions are increasingly accepting IELTS for admissions purposes. \r\n\r\nThe IELTS test consists of 4 modules that test the complete range of English language skills which students commonly encounter when studying or training in the medium of English. The IELTS test is available in two formats: Academic Training and General Training. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking Modules. However, the two formats have different Reading and Writing Modules.\r\n\r\nThe Academic test is suitable for candidates planning to undertake higher education study. The General Training test is suitable for candidates planning to undertake non-academic training or work experience, or for immigration purposes.\r\n\r\nThe IELTS test is also available on computer with results normally released within 5-7 days.\r\n\r\n### 2\\.

Computer based testing is offered throughout most regions of the world. In addition, Internet-based tests (TOEFL\u00ae iBT) are also available in many countries. In areas where computer access is limited, a paper-and-pencil version of the test is administered. \r\n\r\n### 3\\. CAE Cambridge test \u2013 (Certificate in Advanced English)\r\n\r\n[CAE](http://cambridge-english-advanced.cambridgeesol.org/) is a thorough and demanding test of all areas of language ability of the candidate. It is available in a paper-based and a computer-based format. The CAE exam consists of five modules: reading, writing, use of English, listening and speaking (speaking is a face-to-face exam with two candidates and two assessors).\r\n\r\n### 4\\.

However, the Department of Home Affairs (which is responsible for Immigration and Citizenship) assigns certain requirements to student visas for students from certain countries. This means that some students may only be able to study an English course for a limited length of time, depending on their nationality and sector in which they seek to study. \r\n\r\nAustralian education institutions can only accept students with an appropriate level of English proficiency and institutions are free to set their own English language requirements. There may be different language proficiency levels, different measures (eg. IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, PTE Academic) or other ways used to satisfy the language requirement of different institutions for their courses. This may be other than and/or in addition to the levels required for a student visa by DIBP.\r\n\r\n**You should check the English level entry requirements with education providers.**\r\n\r\n### Cost of English language courses\r\n\r\nThe average tuition costs are $305 per week, but course prices vary depending on:\r\n\r\n  * the centre\r\n  * the centre\u2019s location and\r\n  * the length of the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy tour prices are specific to the study program and subject to negotiation.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A5.4 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a5-4-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a5-3-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a5-elicos/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a5-4-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2206, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6bdb073-11b4-4cb9-8c58-d7ab73c72414": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6bdb073-11b4-4cb9-8c58-d7ab73c72414", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a5-elicos\\a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos.md", "file_name": "a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos.md", "file_size": 2250, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81cfda3b-7dc6-4e39-8215-5d8dcbdfccf4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a5-elicos\\a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos.md", "file_name": "a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos.md", "file_size": 2250, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "d11b6901cf5e2cb010defd0bf9ba469a2e0d10fb89de5c3157eacc7b36444dc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a5-elicos\r\ntopic_slug: a5-5-quality-assurance-of-elicos\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A5.5 Quality Assurance of ELICOS\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A5.

According to the Department of Education , in 2022 there were 199,909 international student enrolments in VET courses in Australia (find latest figures [here](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-monthly-summary-and-data-tables)).\r\n\r\n### The Students\r\n\r\nVET students are typically:\r\n\r\n  * schools leavers seeking to acquire practical skills for work\r\n  * school leavers seeking an alternative pathway to university\r\n  * workers who are seeking to further develop their career skills\r\n  * university graduates who need to acquire practical skills for the work or\r\n  * those simply wishing to develop their personal interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Institutions\r\n\r\nThe Australian VET system is publicly and privately funded and is delivered by a wide variety of training institutions and enterprises.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive database of institutions offering VET qualifications can be found at the Training.gov.au website.\r\n\r\n**TAFE \u2013 Technical and Further Education**\r\n\r\nThere are currently 59 TAFE institutes that deliver VET training across Australia. They are government funded, they provide post-school education and training, and they usually have a more practical focus than university courses.\r\n\r\nTAFE colleges act independently of one another and have their own premises, courses, and academic and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nTAFEs can be very large institutions and have more students enrolled than many Universities. For example, most city-based TAFEs have over 50,000 enrolments. The facilities available to students are similar to those in a University. Also, they operate across a number of campuses as well as in industry and community venues.\r\n\r\nTAFE institutes contain some of the largest ELICOS centres in Australia. They are also sometimes part of a University. For example, every university in Victoria except one has a TAFE division.\r\n\r\nTAFE courses are often used by international students as a pathway to undergraduate programs at university, especially via the Diploma route. Some TAFEs offer university degrees through affiliated universities, and some offer their own degrees.\r\n\r\n**Private Colleges**\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 5000 other registered providers of VET courses. These range from small institutions that offer specialised courses in one particular area of study to large private colleges which are similar to larger TAFE institutes.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of VET courses are offered through private colleges. The most popular courses for international students are those related to Business and Information Technology.\r\n\r\nLike TAFE, private colleges are popular with international students as pathway institutions, since they can provide entry to university studies after completing a VET qualification. Also, some private institutions offer university programs through affiliated universities, and others offer their own degrees.\r\n\r\n**VET in Schools**\r\n\r\nOver 95 per cent of Australia\u2019s secondary schools that offer senior secondary programs also offer VET programs to their senior students. This means students can study their senior secondary certificate and they can also be trainees and employees by participating in a work-based pathway, gaining practical work skills and VET qualifications as part of their school education.

Entry requirements vary greatly from institution to institution and from course to course.\r\n\r\nIn general, to begin a certificate level course, students need:\r\n\r\n  * a qualification equivalent to Grade 10-12 in an Australian high school\r\n  * an English language proficiency level of IELTS 6.0 or equivalent (previously 5.5). For packaged  \r\nELICOS courses, the requirement is now 5.0, up from 4.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recognition of Prior Learning\r\n\r\nEntry requirements above certificate level may take into account previous training and experience within an industry. This process is known as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).\r\n\r\nRPL allows a person to receive recognition and credit for the knowledge and skills they have, no matter how and where they were attained, including overseas. This can include skills from:\r\n\r\n  * previous study \u2013 including courses at school or college, through adult education classes or training programs at work\r\n  * work experience \u2013 including both work that is paid and unpaid\r\n  * life experience \u2013 for example leisure pursuits or voluntary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-gustavo-fring-3865901-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo obtain RPL, it is important that a student\u2019s knowledge and skills help to meet the learning outcomes and assessment criteria of the qualification that the student is seeking credit for. RPL assessment can result in a full qualification or a Statement of Attainment for partial completion.\r\n\r\n**You can approach the educational institution that a student wishes to study at and ask for further details about RPL assessment.** Also, assessment-only Registered Training Organisations will assess a student\u2019s skills and experience on a fee-for-service basis.\r\n\r\n### Cost of VET for Overseas Students\r\n\r\nCourse fees vary greatly depending on the course and/or the institution. As a general guide, international students are charged tuition fees of $5,500 to $22,000 (AUD) per year. The average tuition fee is approximately $10,000 per year.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A6.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a6-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a6-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a6-vocational-education-training/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a6-3-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3150, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02029aaf-79fe-4363-a539-28ceb9cc34c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "02029aaf-79fe-4363-a539-28ceb9cc34c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a6-vocational-education-training\\a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system.md", "file_name": "a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system.md", "file_size": 4168, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20d8a51c-0f6b-4134-9125-e6248b298627", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a6-vocational-education-training\\a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system.md", "file_name": "a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system.md", "file_size": 4168, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "b30196f380db88825d667847c34f4284c92cc98ca6ae45f3f60df6ea562fe654", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a6-vocational-education-training\r\ntopic_slug: a6-4-quality-assurance-in-the-vet-system\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A6.4 Quality Assurance in the VET System\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A6.

There are two elements to the VET Quality Framework:\r\n\r\n  * Standards that govern the operations of the organisations ([Registered Training Organisations](https://www.asqa.gov.au/rtos/what-is-an-rto))\r\n  * Standards that govern the nature of the VET courses ([Training Packages and Accredited Courses](https://www.asqa.gov.au/course-accreditation))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 8 VET qualifications which are part of the The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF):\r\n\r\n  * Certificates I, II, III and IV\r\n  * Diploma and Advanced Diploma\r\n  * Vocational Graduate Certificate and Vocational Graduate Diploma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1\\. Registered Training Organisations\r\n\r\nThe NVR Standards for Registered Training Organisations requires them to:\r\n\r\n  * Have documented systems for quality training and assessment\r\n  * Have documented agreements with other organisations when they provide training or assessment in partnership\r\n  * Have written procedures for recruitment, induction and professional development of staff\r\n  * Use trainers and assessors (teachers) with specified skills\r\n  * Follow specific requirements for assessment strategies and\r\n  * Demonstrate that their owners/CEO are suitable individuals to operate an education organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2\\. Training Packages and Accredited Courses\r\n\r\n[Training packages](http://www.asqa.gov.au/about/australias-vet-sector/training-packages1.html) are developed to meet the training needs of an industry, or a group of industries. They specify the skills and knowledge required to perform effectively in the workplace.\r\n\r\nEach training package is made up of three components:\r\n\r\n  * **Units of competency** : which define the skills and knowledge to operate effectively and how they need to be applied to perform effectively in a workplace context.\r\n  * **Qualifications framework** : groups of units of competency ranging from Certificate I to Vocational Graduate Diploma level.\r\n  * **Assessment guidelines** : the industry\u2019s preferred approach to assessment, including the qualifications required by assessors, the design of assessment processes and how assessments should be conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere there are no training packages for a particular workplace available, a VET course may be [accredited](http://www.asqa.gov.au/course-accreditation/accreditation-with-asqa/accreditation-with-asqa.html) by an organisation.

In addition, [Carnegie Mellon](http://www.australia.cmu.edu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/international/australia) have campuses in Adelaide, South Australia. As the main campuses and administrations of these university are established in Pennsylvania, USA and London, UK respectively; we consider them as non-Australian universities. \r\n\r\nMany Australian universities have overseas branch campuses, twinning arrangements and exchange programs for students and teaching staff worldwide. Australian universities have around 7,000 agreements with universities (and similar institutions around the world).\r\n\r\nAustralian Universities have three primary roles:\r\n\r\n  * **Storing** knowledge\r\n  * **Transferring** knowledge to others and\r\n  * **Creating** knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-pixabay-207691-1024x731.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Australian Universities provide consultancy services to business and industry and are a source of advice for Government and the community in general on a large number of issues and topics. They are closely involved with their local and wider communities.\r\n\r\nDiversity and autonomy are central features of Australian universities. Each institution has the freedom to specify its own mission and purpose, modes of teaching and research, the make up of their student body and the range and content of their educational programs. This variety is reflected in the range of goals and objectives, staff profiles and the emphasis placed on particular courses at different universities.\r\n\r\n**As an agent, you need to be aware of the particular goals of the universities that you promote.**\r\n\r\nHigher education in Australia enjoys a strong international reputation. Australian universities are part of a clearly recognised international community of scholarship, with academic staff recruited internationally and students increasingly coming from overseas as well as from across Australia. At the same time, there are increasing numbers of Australian students and staff on study and work exchanges overseas.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A7.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-university-education-in-australia/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-university-education-in-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-1-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3199, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c776fbb-43a8-43e0-b6b0-cd5cebdd4a6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c776fbb-43a8-43e0-b6b0-cd5cebdd4a6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities.md", "file_name": "a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities.md", "file_size": 3988, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48046b7b-137f-4bbc-8831-61dc200a20a1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities.md", "file_name": "a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities.md", "file_size": 3988, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "1ddb1d263a55e38ffd2159bc5fed76f091e59fec02e92cb299c0e19eaeba0a9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a7-university-education-in-australia\r\ntopic_slug: a7-10-how-good-are-australian-universities\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A7.10 How Good Are Australian Universities?\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A7.

It is also true that the Australian education system (especially the universities) are responsible for developing a culture of innovation and discovery.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kvalifik-5Q07sS54D0Q-unsplash-1024x768.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis culture of innovation aims to:\r\n\r\n  * make the best use of national and international information networks\r\n  * encourage creativity in all forms of research\r\n  * promote collaboration between university researchers and industry and\r\n  * disseminate the outcomes of research to the wider community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralian scientists and researchers have been responsible for many advances in business and industry, and have made significant contributions in medical science. Australia has been a pioneer in solar energy research and other potential energy sources. Australian advances in technology include the development of the black box flight recorder, bionic ear implants, a heart pacemaker, the vaccine for cancer of the cervix, and computer hardware and software.

The Federal Government has responsibility for funding the public universities.\r\n\r\nThe formal governing body of each Australian university is the Council, Senate or Board of Governors. This is presided over by a Chancellor who is elected by the members of the governing body. Members are drawn from government, industry, the community, academic staff, graduates and students.\r\n\r\nThe chief executive authority rests with the Vice-Chancellor who is sometimes also called the President. This person is accountable to the Council, Senate or Board of Governors and is responsible for the academic and administrative operations of the institution.\r\n\r\nTeaching and research disciplines are typically organised in several faculties and schools with dedicated Research Centres linking into the faculties. There are also a number of administrative divisions.\r\n\r\nTo see an example of a typical university structure, look at these web pages from the University of Queensland:\r\n\r\n  * [Organisational structure](http://www.uq.edu.au/departments/structure.html),\r\n  * [Organisational unit types](http://www.uq.edu.au/departments/unit_types.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A7.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-university-education-in-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-3-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2309, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee77de66-ebbc-455a-8817-8cbe95769645": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee77de66-ebbc-455a-8817-8cbe95769645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md", "file_name": "a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md", "file_size": 6587, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c3ccd5c-44ff-4f18-8ab1-80bbeb916cd3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md", "file_name": "a7-4-courses-and-qualifications.md", "file_size": 6587, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "5ae7bde456fc0ca54e25c94bbeb80cef5f03b9a0e4bc9f80b8b34115ceec16e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ab79975-f89a-400b-b694-0935dffc31cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1122129bf85ef07d9c4919fcf5cd202d758b2235156fe7d9a9621e4a94bac15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-4-courses-and-qualifications/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a7-university-education-in-australia\r\ntopic_slug: a7-4-courses-and-qualifications\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A7.4 Courses and Qualifications\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A7.

This information is general, so it\u2019s important to understand that a particular university course may not have exactly the same length or purpose.\r\n\r\nAll of these qualifications are listed on the [AQF](https://www.aqf.edu.au/framework/aqf-qualifications).\r\n\r\n**COURSE**| **NOTES**  \r\n---|---  \r\nDiploma  \r\nDuration = 1 \u2013 2 years| \r\n\r\n  * This is offered by some universities and university colleges.\r\n  * It is the same level as a Diploma that is offered by a VET institution.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**UNDERGRADUATE**  \r\nBachelor Degree  \r\nDuration = minimum of 3 years| \r\n\r\n  * This is the basic university qualification and is required for entry to a profession.\r\n  * Study involves acquiring a systematic and coherent body of knowledge, its underlying principles and concepts and associated problem-solving techniques.\r\n  * Students develop the academic skills and aptitudes to comprehend and evaluate new information, concepts and evidence from a wide range of sources. Also, students learn to review, consolidate, extend and apply the knowledge and techniques that they have learned. \r\n  * Study usually involves major studies in an area where significant academic literature is available.\r\n  * Course content is to a significant depth and progressively developed to a high level. This also prepares students for further postgraduate study if desired.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBachelor Degree (Honours)  \r\nDuration = 4 years| \r\n\r\n  * A Bachelor Degree with Honours takes an additional year after a Bachelor Degree with a focus on research.\r\n  * Honours may also be granted where outstanding achievement is recorded in a Bachelor Degree course of four or more years.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**POSTGRADUATE**  \r\nGraduate Certificate  \r\nDuration = 6 months| \r\n\r\n  * The Graduate Certificate typically involves broadening individual skills already gained in an undergraduate program, or developing vocational knowledge and skills in a new professional area.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGraduate Diploma  \r\nDuration = 12 months| \r\n\r\n  * The Graduate Diploma either broadens individual skills obtained in an undergraduate program or develops vocational knowledge and skills in a new professional area.\r\n  * This qualification involves further specialisation within a systematic and coherent body of knowledge.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMasters Degree (Coursework)  \r\nDuration = 1 \u2013 2 years| \r\n\r\n  * The Masters Degree enhances specific professional or vocational skills.\r\n  * It is typically gained by coursework and some research.\r\n  * Study involves acquiring an in-depth understanding of a specific area of knowledge usually by independent research.\r\n  * A Masters Degree takes one to two years, after completion of a Bachelors Degree.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMasters Degree (Research) \u2013 MPhil  \r\nDuration = 1 \u2013 2 years| \r\n\r\n  * The Master of Philosophy program aims to provide research training that develops independent research skills including:\r\n    * ability to formulate a significant problem;\r\n    * mastery of appropriate conceptual and methodological frameworks;\r\n    * capacity for articulate and critical analysis.\r\n  * Admission requires a Bachelor degree with Honours but students may be admitted after completing a Graduate Diploma and having significant work experience.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4658, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name":

Institutions set their own English language requirements. The language proficiency entry levels (e.g. IELTS, CAE or other) may be different from those required for a student visa.\r\n\r\nIf a student\u2019s English language proficiency score is not high enough, there are many English language courses with starting dates throughout the year to prepare them for further study in Australia. All Australian universities either have their own English language centre or have links with English language colleges.\r\n\r\n### Academic Requirements\r\n\r\nInstitutions are free to determine the academic requirements for entry to their courses. These requirements depend on:\r\n\r\n  * The level and content of the education a student has completed in Australia or their home country\r\n  * The level and academic standards of the institution at which they completed their study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, however, the following criteria apply for undergraduate and postgraduate courses:\r\n\r\n### Undergraduate courses\r\n\r\nUndergraduate degrees require an Australian Senior School Certificate of Education (Year 12) or the overseas equivalent of this. Some degrees may also have certain pre-requisite subjects and grades.\r\n\r\nFor international students who have attended an Australian High School, entry to higher education institutions is normally based on completion of Year 12 and determined by the student\u2019s tertiary entrance score or rank.\r\n\r\nA tertiary admissions centre then assesses a student\u2019s tertiary entrance rank in the same way as for domestic students:\r\n\r\n**State/Territory**| **Tertiary Admission Centre**  \r\n---|---  \r\nNorthern Territory| Charles Darwin University  \r\nNSW & ACT| Universities Admissions Centre (UAC)  \r\nQueensland| Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC)  \r\nSouth Australia| South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre (SATAC)  \r\nTasmania| University of Tasmania  \r\nVictoria| Victoria Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC)  \r\nWestern Australia| Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC)  \r\n  \r\nMost universities have specialised pathway programs, such as Foundation courses or Diploma programs that enable international students who do not meet academic requirements to gain entry.\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate courses\r\n\r\nEntry to postgraduate courses requires completion to a satisfactory standard of a Bachelor degree. Prospective students may also need to demonstrate research ability or relevant work experience.\r\n\r\n### Costs of Australian Education for Overseas Students\r\n\r\nUniversity courses in Australia are comparable to those in other English speaking countries. For example, the cost of a Bachelor of Arts may be:\r\n\r\n**Location**| **Yearly Cost**  \r\n---|---  \r\nAustralia| AUD $30,000 to $45,000  \r\nUSA (public university)| AUD $40,000 to $60,000  \r\nUSA (private university)| Exceeding AUD $60,000  \r\nUK| AUD $20,000 to $38,000  \r\n  \r\nIn the Australian education system, some degrees are slightly shorter than in other countries. For example, some Bachelor degrees take three years in Australia but four years in the USA.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A7.6 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-6-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-5-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a7-university-education-in-australia/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a7-6-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4448, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1e9a37b-501e-43cf-9fe0-928fe8794f9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1e9a37b-501e-43cf-9fe0-928fe8794f9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md", "file_name": "a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md", "file_size": 3169, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5422f50-d4f0-4c95-89b0-9ef0e59cf171", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a7-university-education-in-australia\\a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md", "file_name": "a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities.md", "file_size": 3169, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c7812f65753f3918886bb38f0762517fcec33b51d94a859d4750409af24f07e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a7-university-education-in-australia\r\ntopic_slug: a7-7-quality-assurance-of-australian-universities\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A7.7 Quality Assurance of Australian Universities\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A7.

In many countries, universities are officially ranked on a scale. However, the judgments that underlie this kind of \u2018ranking\u2019 can be too subjective and the rank may not necessarily match what is best for a particular student\u2019s individual needs.\r\n\r\nOne commonly referred to international ranking table is the [Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2022) from the Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The ARWU has been published by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy since 2009. A range of other ranking methods are summarised by the [Australian Education Network](http://www.australian-universities.com/rankings/).\r\n\r\nIt is also rare to find a university anywhere in the world that is the \u2018best\u2019 in all that they do. Likewise, a reputation earned in one discipline, perhaps many years ago, may not be relevant to another discipline in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a number of possible indicators that show the relative standings of Australian universities.\r\n\r\n### Entry Standards\r\n\r\nWhile entry levels are fairly uniform for entry into Australian university degrees, different universities do have different requirements for entry into similar courses. The relative academic levels can illustrate which universities are considered better. This can show how, in general, academically more able students choose one university over another to do a similar course.\r\n\r\n### Groups of Universities\r\n\r\nUniversities that share common characteristics have formed groups and networks that to some extent illustrate differences in focus and objectives between groups of universities and the commonalities of those within the group. These groups may be linked through a formal network, such as the [Australian Technology Network](http://www.atn.edu.au/) of Universities (ATN) and the [Regional Universities Network ](http://www.run.edu.au/)which have their headquarters situated in a regional centre. All Australian universities are members of [Universities Australia](http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/), the peak body representing the university sector:\r\n\r\n**Group of 8

areas:\r\n\r\n**AREA**| **DEVELOPMENT**  \r\n---|---  \r\n**Curriculum**|  Many degrees have learning materials that reflect:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * the international content of subject matter and\r\n  * the possible international profile of students undertaking a program.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Student mobility & exchange**| Most universities are promoting the benefits of:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * domestic students undertaking a portion of their studies (and work experience) in another country,\r\n  * international students undertaking their \u2018study abroad\u2019 in Australia.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Institutional partnerships**| \r\n\r\n  * Universities have formed a number of international groups and bi-lateral arrangements to collaborate in research and increasingly in the delivery of specified programs.\r\n  * Private providers tend to be forming partnerships with public universities that target the international education market.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**International Students**| \r\n\r\n  * International students have become very visible on Australian campuses and they represent from 10% to 30% of the total student population.\r\n  * Some universities have specific campuses that are predominately populated by international students.\r\n  * International alumni associations have become important both in recruitment and in advocating for a particular institution.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Structural administration**| \r\n\r\n  * While Universities have a variety of administrative structures, their international activities are headed by a senior management position such as Deputy or Pro-Vice-Chancellor (International).\r\n  * Typically an administrative Director of an International Office manages the strategic and procedural issues.\r\n  * In some cases an autonomous unit is dedicated to international students and international recruitment can exist separate from the main university administration.\r\n  * Some universities have off-shore administrative staff and/or marketing staff and/or offices aiding their activities in that country.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Program delivery**|  Universities have begun to develop means of delivering their programs that increase access for international students such as:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * flexible web-based delivery (including distance education),\r\n  * off-shore campuses, off-shore twinning arrangements,\r\n  * off-shore partners that deliver all or part of their course(s).\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn some cases, regional Australian universities have established metropolitan campuses due to the attraction of the larger cities to international students rather than less popular rural and smaller town environments.  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A7.9 Check Your Knowledge

Specialisations include:\r\n\r\nAccounting;  \r\nAdministration;  \r\nAdvertising;  \r\nAgribusiness;  \r\nArts Management;  \r\nBanking and Finance;  \r\nDevelopment Economics;  \r\nEcological and Environmental Economics;  \r\nElectronic Commerce/Business;  \r\nEvent/Leisure Management;  \r\nCommerce;  \r\nHealth Economics;  \r\nHospitality and Tourism;| Human Resource Management;  \r\nInformation Systems;  \r\nInternational Management/Business;  \r\nLogistics;  \r\nMarketing/Public Relations;  \r\nMicro and Macro Economics;  \r\nOrganisational Behaviour;  \r\nProcurement;  \r\nProperty Studies;  \r\nProfessional Economics;  \r\nPublic Policy;  \r\nReal Estate and Development;  \r\nSocial Planning and Development;  \r\nTaxation.  \r\n---|---  \r\n  \r\n### Qualifications\r\n\r\nBusiness and Economics programs are offered at the following qualification levels:\r\n\r\n  * Certificate\r\n  * Diploma\r\n  * Advanced Diploma\r\n  * Bachelor Degree\r\n  * Graduate Certificate\r\n  * Postgraduate Diploma\r\n  * Masters by research/coursework\r\n  * Professional Doctorates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational Business and Economics training through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. Universities offer more specialised Bachelors Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs.\r\n\r\n\u200bHowever, some TAFEs and colleges offer Bachelor Programs and some universities Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.\r\n\r\nEntry requirements into Business and Economics programs vary depending on the qualification level. The qualification level depends on:\r\n\r\n  * the student\u2019s academic history to date and\r\n  * the student\u2019s career goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a student wanting to become a pastry chef would look at VET programs offered at TAFE and private colleges. A student with aspirations of becoming a hotel executive would look at university level programs.\r\n\r\n### Vocational Education and Training Programs\r\n\r\nTypical programs offered at TAFE and private colleges include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nCertificate| Certificate III in Business Sales  \r\nCertificate III in Mortgage Lending  \r\nCertificate III in Hospitality Operations  \r\nCertificate IV in Business Administration  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Accounting/Commerce  \r\nDiploma of Business  \r\nDiploma of Hotel Management  \r\nDiploma of Retail Management  \r\nDiploma of Marketing  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Business Management  \r\nAdvanced Diploma of Hospitality Management  \r\n  \r\nStudents who have completed the equivalent of Australian grade 10 or 12 would be considered for entry into VET Programs. Typical entry requirements for a Certificate program are completion of the equivalent of Australian grade 10. International equivalent qualifications include completion of:\r\n\r\n  * GCE O Levels\r\n  * the Malaysian SPM\r\n  * the Thai Mathayom Suksa grade 5\r\n  * the American grade 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplomas and Advanced Diplomas have slightly higher entry requirements. Students are required to have completed the equivalent of Australian grade 12 and some programs require work experience. Equivalent international qualifications for admission into Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas include:\r\n\r\n  * GCE A Levels\r\n  * Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM)\r\n  * the Thai Mathayom Suksa grade 6\r\n  * American grade 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nEntry requirements into university level programs are higher than VET programs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4667, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab516600-73ef-4fa3-ab48-4e4dd73e8472": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab516600-73ef-4fa3-ab48-4e4dd73e8472", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53cbf289-9646-4feb-9e2d-95b1b9580fc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "174b6f944c2c95a70e84309f749795306425efb9f8ff581a5dcb590a87affb22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c081eac-59c0-4e0c-8fc5-2e1266217481", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "725ef0a215d80372befcd5f59097ab66e564af0fe670ddfb426cb1c1138e069f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a866189-854a-41b8-bc3e-bcc3ea9450d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b46a27489b7d80269d0bd6c296481e54fb677ea3b024a8543b4c69cc5aa16e4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Typical entry requirements for a Certificate program are completion of the equivalent of Australian grade 10.

Examples of business degrees include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Applied Science  \r\nBachelor of Business  \r\nBachelor of Commerce  \r\nBachelor of Economics  \r\nBachelor of Hotel Management  \r\nPostgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Finance  \r\nGraduate Certificate of Event Management  \r\nPostgraduate Diploma of Human Resource Management  \r\nMasters of Business Administration  \r\nMasters of Financial Management  \r\nMasters of Business  \r\nMasters of Commerce  \r\nMasters of Economics  \r\nProfessional Doctorate in Business  \r\nMasters of Philosophy  \r\nPhD  \r\n  \r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\nAdmission into an undergraduate Business program is generally based on completion of Australian grade 12 or equivalent. In addition, some courses require prerequisite subjects.\r\n\r\nTypically Commerce, Accounting, Banking, Finance and Economic streams have higher entry requirements than Business, Marketing and Human Resource Management streams. Similarly, the latter streams generally have higher requirements than Hospitality, Tourism and Event Management disciplines. For example (at University of Queensland):\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Commerce** \u2013 entry requirements at Australian universities range from an A Level entry requirement of 10 points (in at least two subjects) plus completion of advanced Mathematics at high school to an A Level result equal to 5 points (in at least two subjects) and no prerequisite subjects.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Hotel Management** \u2013 entry requirements can range from an A Level entry requirement of 4 points (in at least two subjects) to 9 points (in at least two subjects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nCoursework postgraduate Business and Economics programs typically require completion of an Australian Bachelor Degree (or equivalent) or have extensive work experience. Examples of Postgraduate programs include:\r\n\r\nEntry requirements into postgraduate Business programs depend on whether they are:\r\n\r\n  * a conversion program (for students without an undergraduate degree in the field); or\r\n  * an advanced postgraduate degree (for students with a relevant undergraduate degree).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of entry requirements include:\r\n\r\n  * **Masters of Business** \u2013 typically include a specialisation and requires students to have completed an undergraduate degree equivalent to an Australian Bachelor Degree in any field.\r\n  * **Masters of Accounting or Financial Management** \u2013 are generally advanced degrees and require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree in Commerce, Accounting, Banking or Finance.\r\n  * **Masters of Business Administration** \u2013 are designed for executives who have work experience post-graduation. Entry requirements range from 10 years work experience with no academic qualifications to an Australian Bachelor Degree or equivalent plus at least two years work experience post-graduation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostgraduate Business and Economics research programs usually require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree with Honours I or II. Some universities accept postgraduate qualifying programs and others require completion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test ([GMAT](https://www.gmac.com/gmat-other-assessments/about-the-gmat-exam/gmat-online)).\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of pathway options available to students not meeting entry requirements in their desired program. For example, many institutions that offer Bachelor Degrees will give credit for prior Diploma studies. This reduces the amount of time a student takes to complete their Bachelor Degree.\r\n\r\n**Not all universities in Australia recognise all qualifications, so care should be taken to ensure that pathway options are available between institutions.**\r\n\r\n_Consider a Thai student who wishes to complete a Bachelor Degree and has completed Mathayom Suksa 5. This student could enrol in a Certificate program, upgrade with credit to a Diploma program and then, depending on their grades, upgrade with credit to a Bachelor Degree._\r\n\r\n### Professional Associations\r\n\r\nMany business programs include internships, practical assignments and placements that provide students with practical experience. For example, many Certificates are traineeship based and combine workplace experience and theory.\r\n\r\nSome vocational and university programs also require placements in the workforce.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3846, "end_char_idx": 9008, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a866189-854a-41b8-bc3e-bcc3ea9450d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a866189-854a-41b8-bc3e-bcc3ea9450d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53cbf289-9646-4feb-9e2d-95b1b9580fc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "174b6f944c2c95a70e84309f749795306425efb9f8ff581a5dcb590a87affb22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab516600-73ef-4fa3-ab48-4e4dd73e8472", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_name": "a8-1-business-and-economics.md", "file_size": 13744, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "d8bbc51a2b12d9388da89d7ebcdee2d2bd33bfc1236a278bca6ba88c1d1faf7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2dc76397-30e8-4085-b3e6-9c1d5fe74eb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e457e7efee835d43ff1a15f612860e0630e5192353b4acb367a508721e5941c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "### Pathways\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of pathway options available to students not meeting entry requirements in their desired program.

Students wishing to pursue law for a career as a practising lawyer (eg. a solicitor or barrister) would enrol in an accredited higher education program such as a Bachelor of Laws (LLB).\r\n\r\n### Vocational & Technical Education Programs\r\n\r\nTypical programs offered at TAFE and private colleges include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Justice Administration;  \r\nDiploma of Justice;  \r\nDiploma of Legal Practice.  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Business (Legal Practice).  \r\n  \r\nStudents who have completed the equivalent to Australian grade 12 would be considered for entry into VET programs. Some programs require students to have achieved a satisfactory grade in English as a pre-requisite. International equivalent qualifications include:\r\n\r\n  * completion of A Levels\r\n  * Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM)\r\n  * All-Indian Secondary School Certificate\r\n  * the International Baccalaureate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nUniversities offer both Legal Administration and Law programs. Typical programs include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Arts (Law major);  \r\nBachelor of Arts in Criminology and Criminal Justice;  \r\nBachelor of Business (Law major);  \r\nBachelor of Laws (LLB);  \r\nBachelor of Laws and Legal Practice;  \r\nBachelor of Justice Studies.  \r\nPostgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Law;  \r\nGraduate Certificate of Legal Education;  \r\nPostgraduate Diploma of Legal Practice Skills and Ethics;  \r\nMasters of Laws (LLM);  \r\nMasters of Applied Law;  \r\nDoctor of Juridical Science;  \r\nJuris Doctor.  \r\n  \r\nThere are two strands of law programs:\r\n\r\n  * those that allow a student to gain knowledge of the law \u2013 for example, Bachelor of Arts in Criminology and Criminal Justice, and Masters of Applied Law\r\n  * those that provide academic qualifications for students wanting to practise law \u2013 for example, Bachelor of Laws (LLB) and Juris Doctor. Typically these kinds of programs have higher entry requirements than the general law programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\n  * Entry to **Legal Administration** programs starts from A Level entry requirement of 5 points (LINK to 8) (minimum of 2 full A Level Academic subjects).\r\n  * Entry to **Bachelor of Laws (LLB)** ranges from A Level entry requirement of 11 points to 10 points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nCoursework postgraduate law programs are available for law professionals wishing to further their studies, for example the LLM; non-law professionals who wish to gain a knowledge in law such as the Masters of Applied Law; and non-law professionals wishing to gain the academic qualifications to practise law such as the Juris Doctor.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae8e0346-34a1-4d29-9843-6c5e7967d528": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae8e0346-34a1-4d29-9843-6c5e7967d528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-2-law.md", "file_name": "a8-2-law.md", "file_size": 7433, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eb782a77-2435-4323-8e1d-fd97c4117474", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-2-law.md", "file_name": "a8-2-law.md", "file_size": 7433, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "9edb211dd82f8a439c0858bab918a4381464ac12ed7901116e4cd2d372cda9ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd41ab90-1639-4f84-ada6-01fd8ce6120f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-2-law.md", "file_name": "a8-2-law.md", "file_size": 7433, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "96f2f3d50d42983dcda36497cb637c63ae7297410ac5f78b4f8ac1af3c8ad958", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Typically these kinds of programs have higher entry requirements than the general law programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\n  * Entry to **Legal Administration** programs starts from A Level entry requirement of 5 points (LINK to 8) (minimum of 2 full A Level Academic subjects).\r\n  * Entry to **Bachelor of Laws (LLB)** ranges from A Level entry requirement of 11 points to 10 points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nCoursework postgraduate law programs are available for law professionals wishing to further their studies, for example the LLM; non-law professionals who wish to gain a knowledge in law such as the Masters of Applied Law; and non-law professionals wishing to gain the academic qualifications to practise law such as the Juris Doctor. Examples of entry requirements include:\r\n\r\n  * **Juris Doctor** \u2013 is designed for non-law graduates wishing to practise law. Entry requirements generally are a recognised Australian Bachelor Degree.\r\n  * **Masters of Laws (LLM)** \u2013 is an advanced law program and can include both research and coursework components. Students are required to have completed an Australian law degree.\r\n  * **Masters of Justice Studies** \u2013 is at the lower end of the entry requirement scale. Students require a pass degree equivalent to an Australian Bachelor Degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch programs in the law discipline usually require students to have completed a bachelor\u2019s degree with Honours I or II.\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nPathways are available for students wishing to pursue Legal Administration or Justice Studies. Pathways for students wishing to enrol in Law, however, are less common due to the accreditation requirements. Pathways tend to be for upgrading academic qualifications.\r\n\r\nCredit is rarely given when students are transferring from Diploma or Advanced Diploma to an LLB at university. Double Degrees are also offered with Law, which allows students to combine Law with another discipline such as:\r\n\r\n  * LLB / Bachelor of Commerce;\r\n  * Bachelor of Engineering / LLB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Professional Associations\r\n\r\nLaw programs in Australia sometimes include a practical component where students acquire some practical experience in a law organisation such as a solicitor\u2019s office. Students are also exposed to Moot Courts and assessed on their performance.\r\n\r\nMost Australian law programs are recognised internationally. However, some students from select countries may be required to complete further studies to practise in their home country.\r\n\r\nOn graduation from a law program students may be eligible for membership to an international professional association such as:\r\n\r\nLaw| \r\n\r\n  * Law Council of Australia ([LCA](http://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/))\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Council of the Bars and Law Societies of Europe ([CCBE](https://www.ccbe.eu/))\r\n\r\n\r\n  * International Law Students Association ([ILSA](http://www.ilsa.org/))\r\n\r\n  \r\n---|---  \r\nLaw Enforcement| \r\n\r\n  * Australian Federal Police Association ([AFPA](http://www.afpa.org.au/))\r\n  * International Police Association ([IPA](http://ipa-iac.org/))\r\n  * Australasian Council of Women and Policing ([ACWAP](http://www.acwap.com.au/))\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Career Opportunities\r\n\r\nCriminologist;  \r\nIntelligence Analyst;  \r\nLawyer/Barrister/Solicitor/Magistrate;  \r\nLegal Aid Officer;| Legal Secretary;  \r\nPolice Officer;  \r\nPrivate Investigator; and  \r\nYouth Worker.  \r\n---|---  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A8.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3649, "end_char_idx": 7417, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac81add8-a5e9-4df6-a7cd-6db2145ff225": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac81add8-a5e9-4df6-a7cd-6db2145ff225", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science.md", "file_name": "a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science.md", "file_size": 8604, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "730220e2-f51f-4346-bbc5-4825ad967d56", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science.md", "file_name": "a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science.md", "file_size": 8604, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "3a7e4a19d2f542f688000ef1a4f661f28ade451a09f59f55a049ea2d560aab9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1048224-5046-4981-bf3b-d5eb42434a0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "759ba2e2fbabbb0c0439b87830c3156c5ad5578cb0137593e2af67253336cc80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\r\ntopic_slug: a8-3-agriculture-environment-and-veterinary-science\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A8.3 Agriculture, Environment and Veterinary Science\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A8.

An exception to this is Veterinary Science. The Bachelor of Veterinary Science provides graduates with the qualification to practise as a Veterinarian. This course is only offered at the university level. In most other specialisations, pathways are available for students wanting to upgrade from Certificates to Diplomas to Advanced Diplomas and on to university studies.\r\n\r\nMost qualifications at both vocational and university levels include practical hands on experience.\r\n\r\n### Vocational Education and Training Programs\r\n\r\nTypical programs offered at TAFE and private colleges include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nCertificate| Certificate in Forest and Forest Products  \r\nCertificate in Animal Studies/Animal Industry Practices  \r\nCertificate IV in Captive Animals  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Agriculture  \r\nDiploma of Conservation and Land Management  \r\nDiploma of Horticulture  \r\nDiploma of Seafood Industries  \r\nDiploma of Veterinary Nursing  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Renewable Energy  \r\n  \r\nTypically, Certificates have the lowest entry requirements, and Advanced Diplomas the highest. Most agricultural, environmental and vet nursing courses offered through a TAFE or private college do not have pre-requisite subject requirements. Examples of typical entry requirements for this discipline include:\r\n\r\n  * **Certificate I in Conservation and Management** \u2013 there are no specific entry requirements.\r\n  * **Diploma of Agriculture** \u2013 completion of the equivalent of Australian grade 12 (including: completion of A Levels; All Indian Secondary School; or International Baccalaureate).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nEntry requirements into Bachelor Degree programs are higher than vocational programs.

Typically Veterinary Science has higher entry requirements than environmental based programs followed by agricultural based programs. For example:\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Agriculture** \u2013 entry requirements range from A Level requirement of 5 to 6 points and students must have achieved a pass in Chemistry or Physics and Mathematics at high school.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Environmental Science** \u2013 entry requirements range from A Level requirements of 9 points down to 5 points and student must have achieved a pass in Chemistry or Physics and Mathematics at high school.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Veterinary Science** \u2013 typically has an entry requirements of 13 A Level points and prerequisite subjects of Mathematics, English, Physics and Chemistry and has quota restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nPostgraduate programs offered in this discipline provide:\r\n\r\n  * re-training of non-professionals;\r\n  * up-grading qualifications;\r\n  * specialised training in specific fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graduate courses designed for students without a relevant degree have lower entry requirements than those courses provided to students upgrading their qualifications in the field.\r\n\r\nPostgraduate research programs usually require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree with Honours I or II. Select universities have pathways available to students wishing to complete a research degree without Honours.\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nThere are several pathway options for students interested in the Agriculture and Environmental disciplines. Fewer pathways exist for students wanting to enrol in Veterinary Science. Many universities offer Diploma and Certificate program articulation pathways to Bachelor Degree levels.\r\n\r\n### Professional Associations\r\n\r\nMost of the programs offered within this discipline include hands-on practical experience such as: laboratory experiments; field studies and research assignments. This experience provides graduates with on-the-job skills before graduation.\r\n\r\nGraduates may be eligible for membership at one of the following professional associations:\r\n\r\nAgriculture| Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/))  \r\nNational Farmers Federation ([NFF](http://www.nff.org.au/))  \r\nInternational Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP)  \r\n---|---  \r\nEnvironment| Australian Conservation Foundation ([ACF](http://www.acfonline.org.au/))  \r\nEcological Society of Australia ([ECOLSOC](http://www.ecolsoc.org.au/))  \r\nEnvironmental Industry Association ([EIA](http://www.envasns.org/))  \r\nFisheries| National Aquaculture Council (NAC)  \r\nAustralia World Aquaculture Society (WAS)  \r\nForestry| Australia\u2019s National Association of Forest Industries (NAFI)  \r\nGlobal Association of Online Foresters (GAOF)  \r\nHorticulture and Viticulture| Australian Institute of Horticulture ([AIH](http://www.aih.org.au/))  \r\nWinemakers Federation of Australia (WFA)  \r\nInternational Society for Horticultural Science ([ISHS](http://www.ishs.org/))  \r\nVeterinary Science| Australian Veterinary Association ([AVA](http://www.ava.com.au/))  \r\nInternational Veterinary Students Association ([IVSA](https://wsava.org/associations/ivsa/))  \r\nWorld Veterinary Association ([WVA](http://www.worldvet.org/))  \r\n  \r\n### Career Opportunities\r\n\r\nAgricultural Scientist/Engineer;

For example, the English language proficiency requirements for the University of Queensland can be found [here](https://study.uq.edu.au/admissions/english-language-requirements).\r\n\r\nExamples of programs offered by universities include:\r\n\r\n**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Nursing;  \r\nBachelor of Dentistry;  \r\nBachelor of Occupational Therapy;  \r\nBachelor of Pharmacy;  \r\nBachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS);  \r\nBachelor of Health Science.  \r\nPostgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Health Services Management;  \r\nMasters of Mental Health Nursing;  \r\nMasters of Nutrition and Dietetics;  \r\nMasters by research of Public Health;  \r\nPhD.  \r\n  \r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\nExamples of typical entry requirements are:\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)** \u2013 has the highest entry requirement of any Health discipline course. Requirements range from admission on the basis of a Bachelor Degree, interview and completion of a Medical pre-admission test such as the GAMSAT or MCAT to the top 1% of school leavers. This equates to 13 points from A Levels. Students enrolling in the MBBS also have to complete clinical and practical training before being allowed to practise as a Doctor.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8e8966d-9276-4000-95f9-e7c9f42899c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8e8966d-9276-4000-95f9-e7c9f42899c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-4-health.md", "file_name": "a8-4-health.md", "file_size": 7702, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04e4d2a3-ada7-4ac9-9f1e-76199531dec9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-4-health.md", "file_name": "a8-4-health.md", "file_size": 7702, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "a68e311ca7f8283b92c3a20321f8f0a1ff858702ee5a9743a038e7da17b76b1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf250da9-b496-44c0-8293-33cbe9a6b75b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-4-health.md", "file_name": "a8-4-health.md", "file_size": 7702, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "655062a0efed402ae3bbe54901da15f7735a1d66ee449a823d12eac0a7146221", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Postgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Health Services Management;  \r\nMasters of Mental Health Nursing;  \r\nMasters of Nutrition and Dietetics;  \r\nMasters by research of Public Health;  \r\nPhD.  \r\n  \r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\nExamples of typical entry requirements are:\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)** \u2013 has the highest entry requirement of any Health discipline course.

The majority of these programs include work placements and internships allowing students to gain on-the-job experience before graduation.\r\n\r\nTypical programs offered at this level include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nCertificate| Certificate IV in Information Technology;  \r\nCertificate IV in Multimedia;  \r\nCertificate IV in Technology in Electronic Engineering.  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Airport Management;  \r\nDiploma of Structural Engineering;  \r\nDiploma of Information Technology (Software Development).  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Information Technology (E Business or E Security);  \r\nAdvanced Diploma of Engineering.  \r\n  \r\nTypically, engineering streams have higher entry requirements than the technology streams. Examples of the range of entry requirements are below:\r\n\r\n  * **Advanced Diploma of Computer Systems Engineering** \u2013 entry is generally only available through articulated entry from Certificate III to Certificate IV to Diploma. Students with prior study in this area may complete a bridging program for admission.\r\n  * **Certificate IV in Information Technology (Client Support)** \u2013 students generally must have completed Australian grade 10 or equivalent (such as Mathayom Suksa Yr 5; O Levels; Taiwanese High School).\r\n  * **Diploma of Information Technology (Software Development)** \u2013 admission is based on a student completing the equivalent to Australian grade 12 (or A Levels; STMP; All-Indian Secondary School Certificate) or articulated entry from a Certificate IV program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nCompletion of a degree at university level allows students to practise as professional Engineers. Programs are devised in conjunction with [Engineers Australia](http://www.ieaust.org.au/) and the [Australian Computer Society](http://www.acs.org.au/). Examples of programs include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Arts (Computer Science/Information Management/Information Technology);  \r\nBachelor of Applied Science;  \r\nBachelor of Computer Science;  \r\nBachelor of Engineering;  \r\nBachelor of Information Technology;  \r\nBachelor of Information Systems;  \r\nBachelor of Technology.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4920, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b181aabb-1a55-430f-b734-46dbdca36d00": {"__data__": {"id_": "b181aabb-1a55-430f-b734-46dbdca36d00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_name": "a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_size": 8683, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d1b7aea-9784-4839-91d2-42cd6e03445d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_name": "a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_size": 8683, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "b6e7d8aef5c151f9e9e4cc55fab7ebace1ecdbfbb6812a6a4320421d310a207d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ca8757f-bc12-46a3-9ca4-b02b12bf7340", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_name": "a8-6-engineering-and-technology.md", "file_size": 8683, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "2c956bcc652e3a44878466e0add7bea6f15c8d90ca3241f8d5a2ea772b488970", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "* **Diploma of Information Technology (Software Development)** \u2013 admission is based on a student completing the equivalent to Australian grade 12 (or A Levels; STMP; All-Indian Secondary School Certificate) or articulated entry from a Certificate IV program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nCompletion of a degree at university level allows students to practise as professional Engineers. Programs are devised in conjunction with [Engineers Australia](http://www.ieaust.org.au/) and the [Australian Computer Society](http://www.acs.org.au/). Examples of programs include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Arts (Computer Science/Information Management/Information Technology);  \r\nBachelor of Applied Science;  \r\nBachelor of Computer Science;  \r\nBachelor of Engineering;  \r\nBachelor of Information Technology;  \r\nBachelor of Information Systems;  \r\nBachelor of Technology.  \r\nPostgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Information Technology;  \r\nPostgraduate Diploma of Engineering;  \r\nMasters by coursework/research; and  \r\nPhD.  \r\n  \r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\nMany universities offer a common first year for Engineering students and then start to specialise in their second year. Similar to vocational education the Engineering streams have higher entry requirements than Technology courses. For example:\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science** \u2013 entry requirements range from 5 points at A Levels with no subject prerequisites to 10 points at A Levels including a prerequisite subject of Mathematics.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Engineering** \u2013 entry requirements range from 5 points at A Levels with subject prerequisites of Mathematics, Physics and or Chemistry to 11 points at A Levels and Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry prerequisites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nPostgraduate programs for Engineering students are generally offered at advanced levels. Within the technology disciplines there are several conversion graduate programs offered. These programs are available for non-technology graduates. For example:\r\n\r\n  * **Masters of Information Technology** \u2013 admission is based on a student completing the equivalent to an Australian Bachelor Degree in any other discipline than Information Technology to a student with an equivalent Australian Bachelor Degree in an Information Technology discipline.\r\n  * **Masters of Engineering** \u2013 students must have completed equivalent to an Australian Bachelor of Engineering Degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nThere are limited pathways linking vocational and university level programs. These are more common in the Technology field than the Engineering field, although a limited number of private colleges have partnered with universities to offer Engineering pathways.\r\n\r\n### Professional Associations\r\n\r\nThe majority of programs offered within the Engineering and Technology discipline are developed in coordination with the appropriate professional body. The courses usually offer internships and work placement. For example, TAFE offers traineeship programs for students already employed in their preferred industry.\r\n\r\nGraduates may be eligible for membership of one of the following professional bodies:\r\n\r\nEngineering| \r\n\r\n  * [Engineers Australia](http://www.ieaust.org.au/)\r\n  * The Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists & Managers, Australia ([APESMA](http://www.apesma.asn.au/))\r\n  * Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ([IEEE](http://www.computer.org/)) Computer Society\r\n  * World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([WFEO](http://www.wfeo.org/))\r\n\r\n  \r\n---|---  \r\nTechnology| \r\n\r\n  * Australian Computer Society ([ACS](http://www.acs.org.au/))\r\n  * Australian Information Industry Association ([AIIA](http://www.aiia.com.au/))\r\n  * Association for Computing Machinery ([ACM](http://www.acm.org/))\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Career Opportunities\r\n\r\nComputer Aided Drawing (CAD) Operator;  \r\nCoal Miner;  \r\nData Communication Technician;  \r\nDesigner;  \r\nTechnician Electrical/Engineering/Electronics;  \r\nFitter and Turner;  \r\nInstrument Maker;  \r\nEngineer;| Digital Designer/Administrator;  \r\nE-commerce Specialist;  \r\nInformation Systems Manager;  \r\nScientist;  \r\nSystems Analyst;  \r\n3D Designer; and  \r\nWeb Designer/Developer.  \r\n---|---  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ A8.6 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-6-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-5-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/a8-6-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4016, "end_char_idx": 8667, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0277d43-ddcf-4206-bbde-480e32138a35": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0277d43-ddcf-4206-bbde-480e32138a35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-7-architecture-and-building.md", "file_name": "a8-7-architecture-and-building.md", "file_size": 8199, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a36d5446-208a-42ba-82a5-6f6b348eaaf2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-7-architecture-and-building.md", "file_name": "a8-7-architecture-and-building.md", "file_size": 8199, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "976aea333d60c3ca880856b60198ef91763f08a48bef2199031893e35cf4f7cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "808f4207-e03e-42a3-89dd-f00859d41352", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "490ce242d32630d6b2ebb325b9996c93889d8a6227e5bbe9721c2ed9a0a79ae4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/a8-7-architecture-and-building/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\r\ntopic_slug: a8-7-architecture-and-building\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A8.7 Architecture and Building\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [A8.

Specialisations available through this discipline include:\r\n\r\nInterior Design/Decoration;  \r\nUrban/Regional/Rural Planning;  \r\nUrban Studies;  \r\nEnvironmental Planning;  \r\nTown Planning;  \r\nLandscape Design;  \r\nConstruction Management;| Building Surveying;  \r\nBuilding Design;  \r\nCabinet-making/Carpentry;  \r\nPlumbing/Tiling/Plastering;  \r\nDrafting;  \r\nLandscape Gardening.  \r\n---|---  \r\n  \r\n### Qualifications\r\n\r\nArchitecture and Building programs are offered at the following qualification levels:\r\n\r\nCertificate\r\n\r\nDiploma\r\n\r\nAdvanced Diploma\r\n\r\nBachelor Degree\r\n\r\nGraduate Certificate\r\n\r\nPostgraduate Diploma\r\n\r\nMasters by research/coursework\r\n\r\nPhD\r\n\r\nTAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational programs through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. These allow students to become tradespeople and gain practical job skills. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs. These programs allow students to practise as professional Architects, Urban Planners and Surveyors.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some exceptions. Some TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs and universities Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.\r\n\r\n### Vocational Education and Training Programs\r\n\r\nTAFE and private colleges offer programs in specific trades associated with the building construction industry. These are offered as traditional programs as well as through traineeships where students learn on-the-job.\r\n\r\nExamples of programs offered at this level include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nCertificate| Certificate IV in Architectural Technology;  \r\nCertificate IV in Building.  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Building Design;  \r\nDiploma of Interior Design.  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Building Design.  \r\n  \r\nEntry requirements vary but typically admission into architectural and design programs are higher than the trade based programs. For example:\r\n\r\n  * **Certificate IV in Carpentry** \u2013 students generally must have completed equivalent to Australian grade 10 (such as Mathayom Suksa Yr 5; O Levels; Taiwanese High School: SMA).\r\n  * **Diploma of Building** \u2013 requires completion of Australian grade 12 or equivalent (A Levels, International Baccalaureate or Canadian OAC).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nCompletion of an Architecture, Planning or Development Degree at university level allows students to practise as professionals in their chosen field. Examples of university level programs include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nUndergraduate| Bachelor of Architecture;  \r\nBachelor of Arts (Architectural Studies);  \r\nBachelor of Science;  \r\nBachelor of Town Planning;  \r\nBachelor of Urban and Regional Planning.  \r\nPostgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Development Planning;  \r\nPostgraduate Diploma of Project Management;  \r\nMasters of Regional Development;  \r\nMasters of Architecture; and  \r\nPhD.  \r\n  \r\n### Undergraduate\r\n\r\nRequirements for entry into specialised programs such as Bachelor of Architecture are generally higher than Bachelor of Arts or Science majoring in Architecture or Urban Planning. However, completion of the latter program would not give students accreditation to practise as a professional. Examples of admission requirements include:\r\n\r\nBachelor of Architecture \u2013 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 11 points at A Levels. Some competitive courses also require students to produce a portfolio to be considered for admission.\r\n\r\nMost university programs in Architecture, Urban Planning and Town Planning include a practical internship.

Specialisations include:\r\n\r\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Studies  \r\nAged Care  \r\nAlcohol and other Drugs Work  \r\nAsian Studies  \r\nChildren\u2019s Services  \r\nCommunity Services  \r\nCounselling  \r\nDisability Services  \r\nFitness  \r\nInterpreting  \r\nLanguage  \r\nLeisure and Health  \r\nMental Health  \r\nSocial Science  \r\nSport and Recreation  \r\nWelfare Services  \r\nYouth Work| Advocacy  \r\nAmerican Studies  \r\nInternational Relations  \r\nPolitics  \r\nAnthropology  \r\nArchaeology  \r\nBehavioural Management  \r\nCognitive Science  \r\nPsychology  \r\nCuratorial Services  \r\nEducation  \r\nEarly Learning  \r\nGeography  \r\nHistory  \r\nInternational Relations.  \r\n---|---  \r\n  \r\n### Qualifications\r\n\r\nHumanities, Social Science and Education programs are offered at the following qualification levels:\r\n\r\n  * Certificate\r\n  * Diploma\r\n  * Advanced Diploma\r\n  * Bachelor Degree\r\n  * Graduate Certificate\r\n  * Postgraduate Diploma\r\n  * Masters by research/coursework\r\n  * PhD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational programs through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. These allow students to gain practical job skills, typically in Community Services and General Studies. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs.\r\n\r\nMany of these programs allow graduates to work as accredited professionals. There are, however, some exceptions. Some TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs and universities, Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.\r\n\r\n### Vocational Education and Training (VET) Programs\r\n\r\nVocational education programs in the Humanities, Social Science and Education discipline are offered either directly through TAFEs and private colleges or through traineeships and internships. Examples of courses include:\r\n\r\nLEVEL| QUALIFICATION  \r\n---|---  \r\nCertificate| Certificate III in Community Services (Aged Care).  \r\nDiploma| Diploma of Language;  \r\nDiploma of Outdoor Recreation;  \r\nDiploma of Theology.  \r\nAdvanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.  \r\n  \r\nEntry requirements vary but typically admission into Community Welfare and Counselling programs are higher than the General Education programs, where audition or portfolios are sometime required for admission. For example:\r\n\r\n  * **Certificate III in Library/Information Services** \u2013 typically this course is suitable for any person wanting to work in libraries and information services.\r\n  * **Diploma of Children\u2019s Services** \u2013 students generally must articulate from the Certificate IV course into this program. Applicants generally must attain Government certification for working with children.\r\n  * **Advanced Diploma of Interpreting (Professional)** \u2013 admission to this course is typically through articulation from the relevant Diploma. Other institutions require applicants to be accredited as a paraprofessional interpreter by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters ([NAATI](http://www.naati.com.au/)), have practical interpreting work experience, and complete prerequisite subjects for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### University Programs\r\n\r\nUniversities usually offer a wide range of specialist and general programs within the Humanities, Social Science and Education disciplines.

Typically, general education programs offered as a major through Bachelor of Arts have lower entry requirements than the more specialised programs such as Psychology, Education and Social Work. Some programs do require students to have completed prerequisite subjects for admissions.\r\n\r\nExamples of admission levels include:\r\n\r\n  * **Bachelor of Arts** \u2013 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 8 points at A Levels. Some institutions require prerequisite courses for admission depending on the chosen specialisation.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Social Work** \u2013 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 9 points at A Levels. Some universities only offer graduate entry programs. Students are required to have completed an Australian Bachelor Degree or equivalent for admission.\r\n  * **Bachelor of Psychology** \u2013 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 12 points at A Levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of specialised programs offered through universities involve a practical component. An example of this is teacher training for Bachelor of Education and placements for Bachelor of Psychology and Social Work.\r\n\r\nStudents enrolling in a Bachelor of Education are usually required to enrol in a dual degree in their preferred teaching area. For example, a student wanting to teach mathematics might enrol in Bachelor of Education/Bachelor of Science (Mathematics).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, some institutions offer graduate entry Bachelor of Education courses. These are designed for students who have completed a general Bachelor Degree and would like to earn the qualifications to allow them to teach in that area.\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate\r\n\r\nAt a postgraduate level a number of institutions offer conversion programs for students who have completed a non-related undergraduate program and wish to change careers.\r\n\r\nAdvanced postgraduate coursework and research programs are also offered. Postgraduate research programs usually require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree with Honours I or II. Select universities do have pathways available to students wishing to complete a research degree without Honours.\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nA number of pathways link VET with university studies in the Humanities, Social Science and Education disciplines.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3449, "end_char_idx": 7228, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b1ad3e9-0665-4b00-93fc-aab055b3a764": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b1ad3e9-0665-4b00-93fc-aab055b3a764", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_name": "a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_size": 11182, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "143382ab-f699-45ef-a860-6358148b9765", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_name": "a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_size": 11182, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "452b5fc0b5df138349f93576cc8c6ebdcc70c9806f6554ac838cd655031e1077", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46768a99-0b4c-4963-83a8-75f2242331de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers\\a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_name": "a8-9-humanities-social-science-and-education.md", "file_size": 11182, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "2178c5bea763db18bc46e94a37048051d2014c44db051037f786d4ecffa06c52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Students enrolling in a Bachelor of Education are usually required to enrol in a dual degree in their preferred teaching area.

Post Secondary School Courses and Careers](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a8-post-secondary-school-courses-and-careers/)\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nLesson Progress \r\n\r\n100% Complete \r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-lil-artsy-1925536-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nAgents often need to explain the relevance of a given course to a student in relation to their proposed career path. This lesson provides an overview of courses and career pathways available through Australian TAFE colleges, private colleges and universities in the following disciplines:\r\n\r\n  * Business and Economics\r\n  * Law\r\n  * Agriculture, Environment and Veterinary Science\r\n  * Health\r\n  * Science\r\n  * Engineering and Technology\r\n  * Architecture and Building\r\n  * Creative Industries\r\n  * Humanities, Social Science and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation on programs and entry requirements in this lesson are general and typical. **Agents should refer to the relevant institution for specific requirements for programs they offer.**\r\n\r\nWhen referring to entry requirements, this lesson uses points awarded for A-level subjects:\r\n\r\n**SUBJECT  \r\nGRADE**| **POINTS**  \r\n---|---  \r\nA| 5  \r\nB| 4  \r\nC| 3  \r\nD| 2  \r\nE| 1  \r\n  \r\nFor example, a university may specify an entry requirement of B-B-C in 3 subjects, which equals 11 points (= 4 + 4 + 3). Note that AS-levels are equivalent to half points (eg. A = 2.5).\r\n\r\n### Focus Questions\r\n\r\n  1. How do the entry requirements for Diploma and Advanced Diploma courses tend to differ from Bachelor degree courses?\r\n  2. For each of the disciplines listed above, what are some of the specialisations that students could study and what careers might they lead to?\r\n  3.

International students apply for a single [Student visa (subclass 500)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500) regardless of their chosen course of study. Student guardians will apply for the [Student Guardian visa (subclass 590)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-590). A single evidence level framework applies to all international students. All students and student guardians will generally be required to lodge their visa application online by creating an account in [ImmiAccount](https://online.immi.gov.au/lusc/login). (see also B2.4)\r\n\r\nStudent visa applicants must have sufficient funds available for the duration of their stay in Australia and should not rely on work to support themselves or family while in Australia.\r\n\r\nAll student visa (subclass 500) holders must maintain enrolment at the same level or a higher Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level for which they were granted a visa, unless they are undertaking a doctoral degree (AQF10) and transfer to a master\u2019s degree (AQF9).  \r\nTransferring to a lower AQF level course or transferring from an AQF level course to a non-AQF Award course is a breach of the student visa condition and might result in the visa being cancelled.\r\n\r\nCheck the [Department of Home Affairs site](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/) or [International Education](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education) site for updates and clarification.\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/a9-extension-useful-information/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Course](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b2-an-introduction-to-regulations-and-legislation/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2598, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0de7c65d-9126-4697-b6e6-a2bb281e459b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0de7c65d-9126-4697-b6e6-a2bb281e459b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md", "file_name": "b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md", "file_size": 2803, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0539aa3f-ba53-41dc-b139-f64078d5dea5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md", "file_name": "b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy.md", "file_size": 2803, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "dd6f61d06862cbe7b7eaf1e781714b9bb5a63bfeb593771b4c0b7a9d1e07fdf1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\r\ntopic_slug: b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B10.1 What Should an Agent Know About Privacy?\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B10.

However, it is possible that they may not be able to obtain any information. These cases are:\r\n\r\n### 1\\. Academic progress and results\r\n\r\nThis circumstance is specific to a student who is 18 or more years old. This means the student is legally considered an adult under Australian law. So, information cannot be provided to anyone unless there is specific instruction from the student.\r\n\r\nQuestion \u2013 Can an agent obtain information about a student\u2019s academic progress in order to provide to a parent or guardian?\r\n\r\n  * Yes \u2013 If the student gives his/her consent in writing for the education provider to provide the results.\r\n  * No \u2013 If the student does not want to give his/her consent.\r\n  * No \u2013 If the student is not available to give their consent. Academic results cannot be obtained even if the agent thinks that the student will agree to provide them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2\\. Medical situations\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult circumstances concerns students who have medical problems. This is because the student\u2019s parents may not speak English well and they may expect the agent to investigate the problem.\r\n\r\nQuestion \u2013 What happens if a student is unable to communicate? For example, the student may have had a serious accident and may be unconscious.\r\n\r\n  * The medical authorities may not agree to communicate with an agent or the education provider.\r\n  * However, the medical authorities will always communicate with the student\u2019s parents / wife / husband (unless the student has expressed a wish for them not to).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical authorities have the power to consider each case and its circumstances. They can decide to release sensitive medical information if they believe it is appropriate, and in the best interests of the student.\r\n\r\nIn these situations, it is better for an agent to work closely with the education provider. This is because the education provider is in a better position to obtain information, especially if the agent lives outside Australia.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ B10.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3157, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1717cc5e-d951-4304-9826-c3bfddc57f16": {"__data__": {"id_": "1717cc5e-d951-4304-9826-c3bfddc57f16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_name": "b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_size": 5826, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d33a3739-d663-43c3-8b14-6f40d4228e61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_name": "b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_size": 5826, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "d5c0edb0dbc5ce0cdcb3895a5bc46cd4c8532ca485498301111a43a837d22f45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bc1a1a9-cb69-499b-8141-5c2993c9d38e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd00605902b9f0ff09dd8031ce692c3dd464f172998e66e45ee01fda3a7ae24a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\r\ntopic_slug: b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B10.3 Student Complaints and Appeals\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B10.

When they have an adverse judgement made against them, (such as failing a subject or not meeting the attendance requirement), they have the right to appeal the decision. In the first instance, these matters will be dealt with internally and the education provider will have a complaints and appeals process that should be followed.\r\n\r\nThe [Commonwealth Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/) deals with complaints made against any private educational institution. Government institutions use a State Ombudsman or range of Tribunals (depending on the nature of the complaint or appeal to serve the same purpose. See this [website for more information](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/support-while-you-study/higher-education-student-complaints#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20is%20to,ask%20them%20about%20their%20process.).\r\n\r\nIf the student wishes to make a complaint, an agent may be asked to help the student understand the process they need to follow or they may be the subject of the complaint themselves.\r\n\r\n### What do overseas students complain about?\r\n\r\nStudents can complain about their education provider if they believe the provider may not have followed the rules correctly or treated them fairly. The common complaints according to the OSO are:\r\n\r\n1\\. Refund & fee disputes (28%)  \r\n2\\. Transfer/release letter external appeals (16%)   \r\n3\\. Unsatisfactory attendance external appeals (11%)   \r\n4\\. Unsatisfactory course progress external appeals (9%)\r\n\r\nComplaints might also be about:\r\n\r\n  * being refused admission to a course\r\n  * course fees and due dates\r\n  * graduation/completion certificates/academic transcripts\r\n  * cancellation of enrolment\r\n  * accommodation or work arranged by a provider\r\n  * incorrect advice given by a provider\u2019s agent\r\n  * inaction or delay, for example, failure by a provider to issue student results within the normal timeframes, or failure to provide services that were included in the student\u2019s written agreement with the education provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OSO do not investigate complaints where a student took more than 12 months to complain.\r\n\r\n### The Process\r\n\r\nWhen a complaint is received, an assessment is first made about whether it is an issue that the OSO can investigate. In some cases, the Ombudsman may decide not to investigate a complaint. This might be because:\r\n\r\n  * the student has not complained to the education provider first, or\r\n  * another organisation is better able to deal with the complaint.(e.g. the police if it is a criminal matter)\r\n  * If a decision is made to investigate a complaint, the Ombudsman will ask the education provider about the problem. The Ombudsman may request relevant documents, or information such as student records from the provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OSO can use formal powers to obtain documents from the education institution and also has the power to enter premises or require a provider to answer questions as part of an investigation.\r\n\r\n### What happens at the end of an investigation?\r\n\r\nAt the end of an investigation the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider has not acted unreasonably, and will advise the student and the provider of this decision.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider failed to take appropriate action or the action appears to have been:\r\n\r\n  * contrary to law\r\n  * unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory or\r\n  * otherwise, in all the circumstances, wrong.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4225, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bc1a1a9-cb69-499b-8141-5c2993c9d38e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bc1a1a9-cb69-499b-8141-5c2993c9d38e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_name": "b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_size": 5826, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d33a3739-d663-43c3-8b14-6f40d4228e61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_name": "b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_size": 5826, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "d5c0edb0dbc5ce0cdcb3895a5bc46cd4c8532ca485498301111a43a837d22f45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1717cc5e-d951-4304-9826-c3bfddc57f16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b10-privacy-student-complaints-and-appeals\\b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_name": "b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals.md", "file_size": 5826, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "1338e542ca06073111daefc318421558d9f499650a1c3755fab4e5ce251fde70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "the police if it is a criminal matter)\r\n  * If a decision is made to investigate a complaint, the Ombudsman will ask the education provider about the problem.

This legislation relates to all people in Australia, and applies to people working with international students. Privacy laws can determine what information can or cannot be provided to an agent.\r\n\r\nIf a student reasonably believes they have not received acceptable services they can make a complaint or if they have received a negative decision they can lodge an appeal. This section will consider the common complaints and the processes to be followed.\r\n\r\n### Focus Questions\r\n\r\n  1. How should a student\u2019s private information be collected and used?\r\n  2. How do privacy laws relate to students aged 18 or over?\r\n  3. How do privacy laws relate to medical situations?\r\n  4. What do students complain about?\r\n  5. What mechanisms are available to make a complaint for an international student in Australia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n100% Complete  3/3 Steps \r\n\r\n[ B10.1 What Should an Agent Know About Privacy? ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)\r\n\r\n[ B10.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ B10.2 When is Privacy a Concern? ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-2-when-is-privacy-a-concern/)\r\n\r\n[ B10.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ B10.3 Student Complaints and Appeals ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-3-student-complaints-and-appeals/)\r\n\r\n[ B10.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b10-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-5-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Course](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Topic ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b10-1-what-should-an-agent-know-about-privacy/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2530, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17bd19bc-470b-43c6-9efa-ec75023ce9bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "17bd19bc-470b-43c6-9efa-ec75023ce9bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_name": "b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_size": 5769, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "200b7f4a-0bb2-46b5-b9a0-7ecf27fafd92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_name": "b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_size": 5769, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "a762166dd3f6b8d3c20abd0bd98562d631c8ae14bfb3b04861e6aaf86048579f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9869dd6-96ff-43da-beaa-79cb0a16bcbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6dab9fd01d37206dea6ec4485f2362a4428afbefefa6d2a89d42a63585066c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B11. Extension: Agency Agreements and Commission\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B11. Extension: Agency Agreements and Commission](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission/)\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\n### Agency Agreements (contracts)\r\n\r\n**Must institutions review and update all their current contracts with their education agents?**  \r\n---  \r\nInstitutions should review the agreements they have in place to ensure they are compliant with the National Code 2018.  \r\n**Can institutions pay a commission to education agents who approach them if they don\u2019t have a written agreement with the agent?**  \r\nYes. Institutions may pay a commission if they do not have a formal agreement with the agent. However they must enter into a written agreement if the relationship changes to an ongoing one where the agent formally represents the institution.  \r\n**Does an institution need to state on a student\u2019s letter of offer that they do not have a written agreement with an agent?**  \r\nThe provider does not have to advise an intending student whether or not they have a written agreement with an education agent.  \r\n**Is an agent without an agreement deemed to be representing the student?**  \r\nIt is not that an agent without an agreement is deemed to be \u2018representing the student\u2019. It is that the institution has not formally engaged the agent to represent it and recruit students for the institution.  \r\n**In their agreements with agents, should providers stop agents giving their commission to students as a way of reducing the students\u2019 tuition? Can an agent give a student their entire commission?**  \r\nAn agent can give a student their commission to reduce the student\u2019s tuition fees. If an institution wanted to prevent this practice they could incorporate the condition into the written agreement with the agent.Except for the requirements prescribed by Standard 4, the content of the business arrangement between the provider and the agent is a matter for the provider and agent to determine and agree.  \r\n**Is an agreement that states that the agent must be \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018not the agent of the provider, but the agent of the student\u2019 compliant with the National Code 2018?**  \r\nThe test for assessing this is to initially ask: Is the agent formally representing the institution? If the agent is not, and they are representing the student, why does the institution have an agreement with them?If the agreement has terms and conditions relating to the scope of the agent\u2019s promotional activities, commissions and the like, then the agent is formally representing the institution regardless of additional provisions it may contain.  \r\n**Are providers who engage education agents to recruit only a small number of students required to have a written agreement?**  \r\nYes, whenever a provider engages education agents to recruit students on its behalf, a written agreement is required.  \r\n  \r\n### Commission\r\n\r\nCommission is a form of payment to an education agent by the education institution for their services. It is usually paid upon the student commencing their studies and may be paid at periodic intervals (normally each semester) while the student remains enrolled in their course.\r\n\r\nThe commission is usually a percentage of the tuition fee. This percentage is set in the written agreement between the provider and the education agent. Standard commission rates vary from 12-15% of the tuition fee for a formal qualification and 20-35% for ELICOS courses.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for providers to increment the commission for their agents based on their performance (e.g. after the first 15 enrolled students the agent will be paid 5% of the tuition fee, then for the next 15 students this fee increases to 10% and if the agent recruits more than 30 students, their commission may be 15%)\r\n\r\nIn cases where the provider doesn\u2019t have a written contract with the agent, they still can pay commission. In these cases it is possible that the provider informs the prospective student (e.g. in the letter of offer), that they do not have an agreement with this agency and therefore the provider is not required under Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) to take responsibility for the activities of the agent. The provider may wish to explain this situation further to the student.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the National Code 2018, if the relationship becomes ongoing, then a written agreement must be signed by both parties.\r\n\r\nSome agents give part or whole of their commissions back to their student as an incentive.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4845, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9869dd6-96ff-43da-beaa-79cb0a16bcbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9869dd6-96ff-43da-beaa-79cb0a16bcbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_name": "b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_size": 5769, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "200b7f4a-0bb2-46b5-b9a0-7ecf27fafd92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_name": "b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_size": 5769, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "a762166dd3f6b8d3c20abd0bd98562d631c8ae14bfb3b04861e6aaf86048579f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "17bd19bc-470b-43c6-9efa-ec75023ce9bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission\\b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_name": "b11-extension-agency-agreements-and-commission.md", "file_size": 5769, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "2ca5e2fa4ec59221261d2d1467481d2f876f25ade2ea9680d8efd62574847128", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "after the first 15 enrolled students the agent will be paid 5% of the tuition fee, then for the next 15 students this fee increases to 10% and if the agent recruits more than 30 students, their commission may be 15%)\r\n\r\nIn cases where the provider doesn\u2019t have a written contract with the agent, they still can pay commission.

This could be due to a natural disaster (such as a fire) or because of financial difficulties. If this happens, the consumer protection provisions of the ESOS Act are there to support the student.\r\n\r\nUnder the ESOS Act, the provider has the primary obligation to provide a student with a refund; if a course does not start when agreed, or ceases to be provided after it has commenced.\r\n\r\nA refund may also be payable if a student withdraws from a course under the provider\u2019s own refund policy.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to a refund the provider can place a student in an alternative course, at no additional cost to the student, if the student agrees to this.\r\n\r\n### The Tuition Protection Service\r\n\r\nThe Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is an initiative of the Australian Government to assist international students whose education providers are unable to fully deliver their course of study. The TPS ensures that international students are able to either:\r\n\r\n  * complete their studies in another course or with another education provider or\r\n  * receive a refund of their unspent tuition fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tuition Protection Service is a mechanism to place students when a provider fails to meet its obligations to provide the program (called a provider default).\r\n\r\nWhere there is a provider default, the provider must either refund affected students the unexpended portion of their prepaid tuition fees, or to offer an alternative place which is accepted in writing by the student.\r\n\r\nThe TPS gives students control and responsibility within the placement process by allowing students to make a choice from available alternative placement options. \r\n\r\nFor example, if a College closes, and the provider is unable to provide the students with a refund or an alternative course, students will be offered a place in the same or a similar course with other Colleges in the same area. There will be no extra cost to the students and they will be able to complete their studies.\r\n\r\nUnder the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) framework, all providers have a statutory obligation to report to the TPS Director and the Secretary about provider and student defaults (when a student leaves the institution).\r\n\r\nThe ESOS legislation details a limit of 50% in the amount of prepaid tuition fees a provider can demand from a student before they commence their course (unless the course is 24 weeks or less when they can require 100% of the fees to be paid). If they wish, students can choose to pay any amount of their course fees in advance.\r\n\r\nESOS also requires providers not administered by a state authority or eligible to receive recurrent Commonwealth funding (i.e. Private Providers) to keep any initial prepaid tuition fees in a designated account before the student commences the course.\r\n\r\n### What does an Agent need to do if a closure occurs?\r\n\r\nIf an institution closes, the Tuition Protection Service and Australian Government will work to ensure that all students are placed in a suitable alternative course.\r\n\r\nIf students affected by the closure approach you, you should refer the students to the [Tuition Protection Service](https://tps.gov.au/). \r\n\r\nIf your student is affected by the closure of their course/education provider and the student needs to apply for a new student visa in order to continue their studies, they may be eligible for exemption from paying the student visa application fee.

Students must have sufficient information to enable them to make informed decisions about studying with their chosen registered provider in Australia.\r\n\r\n### Standard 3 Formalisation of enrolment and written agreements.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must formalise their enrolment of overseas students through written agreements with overseas students. The written agreements protect the rights and set out the responsibilities of each party, as well as the courses and related education services to be provided, tuition and non-tuition fees payable, and refund policies.\r\n\r\n### Standard 4 Education agents.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must ensure that their education agents act ethically, honestly and in the best interests of overseas students as well as uphold the reputation of Australia\u2019s international education sector.\r\n\r\n### Standard 5 Younger overseas students.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers of overseas students aged under 18 must meet legislative or other regulatory requirements relating to child welfare and protection. Registered providers of overseas students aged under 18 must provide the students with emergency contact information and information about how to report actual or alleged abuse. Where the registered provider has taken on responsibility for the approval of welfare arrangements for a student who is under 18 years of age (for the purposes of the Migration Regulations), the registered provider must ensure the arrangements for the younger students are suitable, ongoing and appropriately managed until the student turns 18 years of age.\r\n\r\n### Standard 6 Overseas student support services.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must assist overseas students to adjust to study and life in Australia and have appropriate orientation programs that help overseas students to access the information and services they require.\r\n\r\n### Standard 7 Overseas student transfers.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must not knowingly enrol an overseas student wishing to transfer from another registered provider\u2019s course prior to the student completing six months of his or her principal course (or for the school sector, until after the first six months of the first registered school sector course), except in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n### Standard 8 Overseas student visa requirements.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must safeguard the integrity of Australia\u2019s migration laws by supporting overseas students to complete their course within the required duration and fulfil their visa requirements for course attendance and course progress. Standard 8 sets flexible provisions to allow online learning while maintaining appropriate standards for overseas students to comply with student visa conditions.\r\n\r\n### Standard 9 Deferring, suspending or cancelling the overseas student\u2019s enrolment.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must appropriately manage the enrolment of their overseas students and ensure all necessary information about enrolments has been provided to the relevant government department by maintaining updated information in the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) database.\r\n\r\n### Standard 10 Complaints and appeals.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must ensure their overseas students have the right to natural justice protected through access to professional, timely, inexpensive and documented complaints handling and appeals processes.\r\n\r\n### Standard 11 Additional registration requirements.\r\n\r\nThis standard sets out that registered providers must continue to meet the requirements for CRICOS registration and ensure the ESOS agency for the registered provider approves, and has up-to-date

This is reflected in the National Code 2018.\r\n\r\nStandard 4 has been strengthened so that conditions of written agreements and agent behaviour are clearer, to ensure that an agent:\r\n\r\n  * does not engage in false or misleading conduct,\r\n  * declares and avoids conflicts of interest,\r\n  * observes appropriate levels of confidentiality and transparency in dealing with students,\r\n  * acts honestly and in good faith.\r\n  * understands and meets the expectations of the Australian International Education and Training Agent Code of Ethics.

If an agent does not comply with the terms of the conditions, the provider must take corrective action.\r\n\r\nCorrective action may include:\r\n\r\n  * providing additional information/material or targeted training in, for example, the expectations of the provider\r\n  * refusal to accept any more students from the agent\r\n  * not allowing the agent to use PRISMS for them\r\n  * deciding not to work with the agent\r\n  * terminating the agreement with the education agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 4.2 of the National Code 2018 states that the written agreement between a provider and their agents must outline:\r\n\r\n4.2.1 the responsibilities of the registered provider, including that the registered provider is responsible at all times for compliance with the ESOS Act and National Code 2018\r\n\r\n4.2.2 the registered provider\u2019s requirements of the agent in representing the registered provider as outlined in Standard 4.3\r\n\r\n4.2.3 the registered provider\u2019s processes for monitoring the activities of the education agent in representing the provider, and ensuring the education agent is giving students accurate and up-to-date information on the registered provider\u2019s services\r\n\r\n4.2.4 the corrective action that may be taken by the registered provider if the education agent does not comply with its obligations under the written agreement including providing for corrective action outlined in Standard 4.4\r\n\r\n4.2.5 the registered provider\u2019s grounds for termination of the registered provider\u2019s written agreement with the education agent, including providing for termination in the circumstances outlined in Standard 4.5\r\n\r\n4.2.6 the circumstances under which information about the education agent may be disclosed by the registered provider and the Commonwealth or state or territory agencies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4636, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

This can be found at Part 4, Division 2 of the [ESOS Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00292).\r\n\r\nThe National Code 2018 commenced on 1 January 2018. Education providers must comply with the National Code to maintain their registration to provide education services to overseas students.\r\n\r\nThe Code covers the conduct of education providers delivering services to overseas students. It places clear responsibilities on all educational providers and their agents. Summary documents of the Code and its key requirements can be found [here](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Pages/National-Code-2018-Factsheets-.aspx).\r\n\r\n**How does The National Code relate to Agents?**\r\n\r\nAn agent\u2019s behaviour is the direct responsibility of the education provider if there is an agreement with that provider. So, if you make a mistake or behave dishonestly, the education provider will be held responsible for your actions.\r\n\r\n**How is the National Code 2018 organised?**\r\n\r\nThe National Code is composed of 11 Standards. Standard 4, in particular, sets out that registered education providers must ensure that their education agents act ethically, honestly and in the best interests of overseas students as well as uphold the reputation of Australia\u2019s international education sector. Registered providers need to enter and maintain details of education agents with whom they have a written agreement in PRISMS.\r\n\r\n### Focus Questions\r\n\r\n  1.

This code identifies the institution as a registered provider of education and training services to overseas students. Providers are required by law to include their provider code in all marketing material. For example, an institution\u2019s website usually shows the code at the bottom of each web page.\r\n\r\n### Why is the CRICOS Provider Code important?\r\n\r\n  * It identifies the education institution as a registered provider of education and training to overseas students.\r\n  * It clarifies who is legally responsible for provider obligations under the ESOS Act. This is important both for students and agents.\r\n  * Where more than one provider is involved in the delivery of a course, only one provider is registered on CRICOS to deliver the course. The CRICOS Code ensures clarity about who is responsible for any obligation under the ESOS Act and the National Code 2007.  \r\nFor example, a university may enter into an approved arrangement for a college to run one of its courses on its behalf or a number of institutions may form a partnership to offer a particular course. The registered provider will be responsible for all the obligations under the ESOS legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b5-cricos/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b5-cricos/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Topic ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2061, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36e4f2e0-817f-4d95-8c47-00c25d551aba": {"__data__": {"id_": "36e4f2e0-817f-4d95-8c47-00c25d551aba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b5-cricos\\b5-2-cricos-course-code.md", "file_name": "b5-2-cricos-course-code.md", "file_size": 1335, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7e80fdb-5315-471e-b866-4b7155ccaff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b5-cricos\\b5-2-cricos-course-code.md", "file_name": "b5-2-cricos-course-code.md", "file_size": 1335, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "239f7b904ba098653084b00bc21da1883783af55b3104d2e629884566b44f2e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b5-2-cricos-course-code/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: b5-cricos\r\ntopic_slug: b5-2-cricos-course-code\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B5.2 CRICOS Course Code\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B5.

It is an online register of all the courses and institutions that are available to students who wish to obtain a student visa.\r\n\r\nInstitutions offering education or training services to students studying in Australia on student visas are required to comply with the Federal legislative requirements for registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).\r\n\r\nSome students may study a short course on another type of visa (tourist or working holiday visa) which permits them to study for a short period and may not be listed on CRICOS. Such students in Australia on visas other than student visas are not covered under the ESOS Act.\r\n\r\n### Focus Questions\r\n\r\n  1.

This differs from CRICOS, which is a publicly accessible database.\r\n\r\nPRISMS is used by education providers more than agents. However, a provider may give its agent(s) the authority to create CoEs.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Executive Officer (PEO) or an authorised delegate of the provider can allow an agent to access PRISMS for that provider\u2019s courses. The agent can then create a CoE or advise on course information. The PEO is also listed on CRICOS for each provider.\r\n\r\nIf the agent creates a CoE, then\r\n\r\n  1.

This is a web-based document created by PRISMS that records which course or courses a student is enrolled in.\r\n\r\nIf a student intends to study more than one course, more than one CoE is produced. This allows the student to get a student visa for the combined length of all the courses. This is often referred to as a \u2018Package\u2019 visa.\r\n\r\n### Producing a CoE\r\n\r\nThese are the steps that are followed:\r\n\r\n  1. The provider agrees to enrol the student.\r\n  2. The provider authorises and prints a copy of the CoE and provides it to the student and/or agent.\r\n  3. The information on the CoE is transmitted to DHA via PRISMS.\r\n  4.

Depending on the circumstances, the student may or may not need to be directly involved.\r\n\r\nStudents wishing to change provider do not need to approach DIPB unless they are changing the sector of the principal course of study.\r\n\r\n### Reporting for non-compliance of Student Visa Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why an educational provider uses PRISMS to report students to DHA for non-compliance:\r\n\r\n  * Non attendance in classes;\r\n  * Unsatisfactory academic performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor these two reasons, the student is breaching the conditions of their student visa, so:\r\n\r\n  * During the reporting process, PRISMS generates a formal letter that is sent to the student. This letter asks them to explain their circumstances to DHA.\r\n  * The letter states that the student has 28 days to make an appointment at a DHA office.\r\n  * If the student does not make an appointment, then his/her visa may be cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current postal address**  \r\nIf the student has not provided the institution with a current postal address, the formal letter may not reach the student. Consequently, the student may not realise that an appointment is necessary. In this situation:\r\n\r\n  * the student visa is still cancelled, because it is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure the provider has their current postal address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**A valid reason for non-compliance**  \r\nThe student may have a valid reason for the non-compliance. For example, the student was sick (the student also needs to have medical certificates to prove this). After the interview with the student, DHA may decide not to cancel the visa.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ B6.4 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b6-4-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b6-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b6-4-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3402, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "528d46a0-6810-4e01-aa60-1b26fa20853c": {"__data__": {"id_": "528d46a0-6810-4e01-aa60-1b26fa20853c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b6-prisms\\b6-prisms.md", "file_name": "b6-prisms.md", "file_size": 2475, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51250a9c-5f99-4ee9-a41e-042a8bb87f75", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b6-prisms\\b6-prisms.md", "file_name": "b6-prisms.md", "file_size": 2475, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "cbde223d58ab806bafa7ca64eda8cb2cc16bdc5fe0bcfd92fa657ee7d40004ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b6-prisms/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: b6-prisms\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B6.

Experience has demonstrated that in the aggregate, applications from different countries and for different education providers, indicate different rates of student fraud and other visa cancellation events.\r\n\r\nThe Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF) provides the evidentiary requirements for each student application on the basis of a combination of the rating of the student\u2019s country of citizenship and the rating of the provider with which they will undertake their principal course of study.\r\n\r\nThese ratings are updated each 6 month period on the basis of:\r\n\r\n  * Rate of visa cancellations\r\n  * Rate of visa refusal due to fraud\r\n  * Rate of visa refusal not due to fraud\r\n  * Rate of student visa holder becoming unlawful (overstaying their time in Australia)\r\n  * Rate of student visa holders applying for a Protection visa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplications with regular evidentiary requirements are required to provide evidence of English proficiency and financial capacity with their applications, while those classed as streamlined are generally able to satisfy the Department of their financial capacity by a declaration and are not generally required to provide evidence of their English language proficiency. However, DHA retains the discretion to seek further evidence where appropriate.\r\n\r\nApplicants who provide all requested documentation with their visa application are generally processed quicker. \r\n\r\nNote that a student\u2019s nationality is determined by:\r\n\r\n  * the nationality that is recorded in the student\u2019s passport at the date of the application;\r\n  * not where the student lives;\r\n  * not where the student applies for the student visa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Evidentiary Framework and Evidence Levels\r\n\r\nThe SSVF \u2018evidentiary framework\u2019 is based on student immigration outcomes over a period of time. It serves only to guide whether a Student visa applicant is subject to streamlined (S) or regular (R) evidentiary requirements. Ratings are calculated using a weighted average based on the total numbers of international students (applicants and holders of Student visas) that have a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) to study a course from the education provider.\r\n\r\nThe following weightings and indicators are used to calculate the evidence level of each education provider and country:\r\n\r\n**Rate of visa cancellations (25% weighting)**\r\n\r\nThe proportion of cases, once a student has been provided a visa which was then cancelled due to:\r\n\r\n  * non-genuineness\r\n  * fraud\r\n  * breaches of visa condition 8202 (i.e. maintaining enrolment, attendance and course progress)\r\n  * breaches of work condition 8105 (i.e. cannot work more than 40 hours per fortnight when course is in session)\r\n  * breaches of other visa conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_NOTE: There are temporary 8104 and 8105 visa conditions that allow students to work more than 40 hours per fortnight, and similar allowances for family members. See[here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/see-your-visa-conditions?product=500#) and [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/temporary-relaxation-of-working-hours-for-student-visa-holders)._**\r\n\r\nStudent visa cancellations where the student personally requests visa cancellation are not included. For example, a student who has ceased study and returned home may request visa cancellation.\r\n\r\n**Rate of refusals due to a fraud reason where the applicant lodged overseas (40% weighting)**\r\n\r\nThe proportion of students who were refused a visa at the application stage due to fraud.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4576, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f240866-dec9-4425-941d-8fa8cdf4c582": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f240866-dec9-4425-941d-8fa8cdf4c582", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes\\b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_name": "b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_size": 8654, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb9808f3-e7b9-423c-a70c-6484532e86f2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes\\b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_name": "b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_size": 8654, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "782fcb23b23085b7111d16e2f936462dadd63627154472d4a825e67d00bb3b1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b38ed64-198d-4aec-99af-f62ef1768d7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b7-student-visas-basic-requirements-and-processes\\b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_name": "b7-2-evidentiary-framework-and-student-visa-processing.md", "file_size": 8654, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "7ce7f143e3b05a750f15478a888cb605f396fe53400877b4aa523e55f71629f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07bce816-0288-4771-b6aa-d383f363351e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "533384689135479dd4a9aa4378be6dd7165acef270b252a2efbf1b80eedf4281", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "See[here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/see-your-visa-conditions?product=500#) and [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/temporary-relaxation-of-working-hours-for-student-visa-holders)._**\r\n\r\nStudent visa cancellations where the student personally requests visa cancellation are not included.

That is, one of the legal requirements for the grant of the visa was not met and no fraud was detected. For example, not meeting the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE), health or other requirements.\r\n\r\n##### \r\n\r\n**Rate of student visa holders becoming unlawful non-citizens (15% weighting)**\r\n\r\nThe number of students that have overstayed their student visa for more than 28 days. Students who have been unlawful and resolve their immigration status within 28 days are not counted. These figures represent those visa holders who did not contact the Department to arrange a Bridging visa or another visa and overstayed their visa for more than 28 days.\r\n\r\n##### \r\n\r\n**Rate of Subsequent Protection Visa applications (10% weighting)**\r\n\r\nThe proportion of students who applied for a Protection Visa (PV) where the last visa held by them was a Student visa.\r\n\r\n#### Evidence Level Allocation\r\n\r\nEvidence level ratings are allocated to each education provider and country as follows:\r\n\r\n**Index****(Weighted average of all indicators)**| **Evidence level rating**  \r\n---|---  \r\nBelow 1.0| One  \r\nBetween 1.0 and 2.70| Two  \r\nAbove 2.70| Three  \r\n  \r\nAn education provider is linked to its students by the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) held at the time the Student visa application was decided. This means that if a Student transfers to another education provider, their Student visa (and any behaviour linked to evidence level ratings) will continue to be linked to the original education provider specified on the CoE. This will continue until the student is granted a further visa.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there are only a small number of students, statistical calculations of evidence level are unreliable. Such \u2018small\u2019 providers (or countries) are those who have less than 50 active students studying on a principal course at any one time during the previous 12 months.\r\n\r\nSmall providers are given a default rating of Two.\r\n\r\nCountries who supply less than 50 students are given a default rating of Three.\r\n\r\nThese ratings are updated each 6 months from the historical data generated during the previous 12 month period.

However, as of March 23, 2024, the GTE requirement has been replaced by a new Genuine Student (GS) requirement for student visa applications. This change was part of a broader effort to streamline the application process and enhance immigration integrity. The GS requirement involves answering targeted questions rather than submitting a lengthy statement. This aims to provide visa decision-makers with clearer insights into applicants\u2019 intentions and circumstances. Applications submitted before this date will still be assessed under the GTE requirement.\r\n\r\nWhile evidence of finance and English is not required with the visa application, DHA retains the right to ask for financial evidence from any student if there is specific intelligence that suggests there may be a problem with the financial capacity of the student.\r\n\r\n#### Regular Evidentiary Requirements\r\n\r\nRegular applications require a student to present two extra pieces of evidence with their visa application: financial capacity and English language proficiency evidence.\r\n\r\n#### Evidence of Financial Capacity\r\n\r\n_Genuine Access Requirement_\r\n\r\nTo obtain an Australian student visa, applicants must demonstrate sufficient funds to  \r\ncover:\r\n\r\n  * Tuition fees for the first year of study\r\n  * Living expenses for the first year in Australia\r\n  * Travel costs for the student and any accompanying family members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll funds that can be accepted as evidence must be clearly available to the student in order to pay for their studies and living costs. The factors that may be considered include:\r\n\r\n  * The relationship of the sponsor (e.g. a parent or guardian\u2019s funds are appropriate, but \u201cfamily friends\u201d bank accounts are not normally acceptable)\r\n  * Income, assets and employment history of sponsor/parent\r\n  * Previous visa history of the student (e.g. have they have had difficulties in the past)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents cannot rely on their ability to earn money through work in Australia as evidence of having funds.\r\n\r\nThe following are sources of evidence of financial capacity:\r\n\r\n  * money deposit with a financial institution (bank)\r\n  * loan with a financial institution (bank)\r\n  * government loans\r\n  * scholarship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three options to provide financial evidence.\r\n\r\n**_Option 1: 12 months living expenses_**\r\n\r\nShow evidence of funds for travel costs plus 12 months of living and tuition costs.

Where the student intends to package courses to combine their preliminary course of study with their main course of study, the education provider evidentiary requirements rating applied to the Student visa application would correspond to the student\u2019s main course of study (or principal course).\r\n\r\nThe principal course is the course that the student intends to undertake in Australia at the highest level. For example, a student may intend to study 3 courses in this order from lowest to highest level:\r\n\r\n  1. An ELICOS program, then\r\n  2. A foundation program, then\r\n  3. An undergraduate program (the principal course).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that student has a package of courses that provides clear course progression to the undergraduate degree, then the rating that corresponds to the provider of the undergraduate program will be applied in the visa process.\r\n\r\nDHA will only recognise a package of offers if the student has a CoE (for applications made outside Australia) or a letter of offer (for applications made in Australia, noting a CoE will be needed before the visa can be granted) of a place into all the courses, including the highest-level course from the education institution(s). It is not enough that the student intends to continue to study at a higher level than the first course they undertake but does not have a CoE for the higher level course.\r\n\r\nA letter of offer for a course can be conditional on the student successfully completing a previous course. In the above example, the student may have to successfully complete the foundation program before continuing to the undergraduate program.\r\n\r\nA package of courses must also increase in level across the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). For example, a student cannot study a course of a lower level after one of a higher level.\r\n\r\n#### Visa Duration\r\n\r\nThe duration of a Student Visa generally depends on the dates of study detailed in the CoEs that are submitted with the application. In general, the visa granted will cover the full length of every CoE that is in a sequence or package, if the evidences provided satisfy the visa requirements. The following table shows the general guidelines used:\r\n\r\n**Duration of Course**| **Duration of Visa**  \r\n---|---  \r\n10 months or less| Student Visa normally granted for one month longer than the end date of the principal course  \r\nLonger than 10 months| Student Visa normally granted for two months longer than the end date of the principal course, if it ends before November.

So certain requirements apply to these students. The student must provide evidence of adequate welfare arrangements for the duration of their visa, or until they turn 18, to make a valid visa application. \r\n\r\nThe student must show they have adequate welfare arrangements in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n  * live in Australia with a parent or legal custodian (applicant must complete Form 157N to nominate a Student Guardian).\r\n  * live in Australia with a relative who is a Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) holder (guardian must apply for this visa and complete Form 157N) or holding other valid visa in Australia. The relative must be over 21 years of age with good character and be nominated by the parents or custodians.\r\n  * the student\u2019s education provider will provide for their general welfare and accommodation (provider will issue a Confirmation of Adequate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW) letter.\r\n  * A secondary exchange student must provide their AASES form. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the student will be living with a relative (but not the parent), the nominated relative must:\r\n\r\n  * be a brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, step-grandparent, step-aunt, step-uncle, step-niece or step-nephew\r\n  * be aged over 21 years\r\n  * have the right to remain in Australia until the visa expires or the student turns 18 years-of-age (whichever happens first)\r\n  * and have a police clearance check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student\u2019s parents or custodian need to prove that the nominated relative meets these criteria.\r\n\r\nThe student\u2019s parent or custodian must complete Form 1229 \u2013 Consent to grant an Australian visa to a child under the age of 18 years.\r\n\r\n#### Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW)\r\n\r\nIf a younger student is not living with a parent or suitable relative, the education provider must sign a Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW) letter approving the student\u2019s general welfare and accommodation arrangements before the student visa can be issued. The provider must nominate two dates:\r\n\r\n  1. when the provider has elected to begin taking responsibility for the student\u2019s welfare, and\r\n  2. when the provider will cease to take responsibility for approving the welfare arrangements for that student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a student\u2019s welfare arrangements are approved by education provider students must not travel to Australia until the welfare arrangements are due to commence. Dates are nominated by the provider not the student.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ B8.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b8-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b8-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b8-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3844, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d50189b-c7a0-480d-a6db-8fce2b722871": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d50189b-c7a0-480d-a6db-8fce2b722871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\\b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_name": "b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_size": 5194, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bde71043-e2ba-4bc9-9ae6-cc36a88e4cfc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\\b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_name": "b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_size": 5194, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c5bb1893b170343d7625f5c9576f29f17134d53a819b7b8c543103f2ad0ddacf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56bded43-ad8f-46d1-99bb-40d34f8d131f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74dfa356a52723179a735d204dd5e33bf746a41b511b9cbb97be796cd687bac0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\r\ntopic_slug: b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B8.3 Specific Requirements in Particular Cases\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B8. Student Visas: Application Processes, Specific Requirements and Integrity Concerns](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns/) [B8.3 Specific Requirements in Particular Cases](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases/)\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nLesson Progress \r\n\r\n100% Complete \r\n\r\n### School Sector\r\n\r\n#### Age Requirements\r\n\r\nThere are age limits set for international students intending to study in the School sector.\r\n\r\nThese are the age requirements that apply:\r\n\r\n  * A primary school student must be at least 6 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary students must:\r\n\r\n  * be less than 17 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 9\r\n  * be less than 18 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 10\r\n  * be less than 19 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 11\r\n  * be less than 20 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Visa Grant period\r\n\r\nA primary school student will only be granted a visa for a maximum period of two years. This requirement will assist to manage the welfare and immigration risks association with younger students. Note: If a student enrols mid-year, the visa will be granted for a maximum of two and a half years.\r\n\r\nFurther, a student intending to study in Australia from primary school and through secondary school will not meet the GTE requirement. This is because integration into their home country will be unlikely after completing their formative education in Australia.\r\n\r\nThis does not prevent a student from applying for a further visa for two years after completing two years of primary school, however GTE will be closely assessed. \r\n\r\n#### Secondary exchange students\r\n\r\nSecondary exchange students have an option of providing a completed AASES form as meeting their financial evidence and welfare arrangements requirement.\r\n\r\nSchool students are exempt from providing evidence of English language proficiency.\r\n\r\n### Other Matters\r\n\r\n#### ELICOS Courses\r\n\r\nThere is no limitation on the maximum duration of ELICOS study that may be undertaken. Genuine students will be able to undertake as much ELICOS study as either a standalone course or prior to their principal course, as required.\r\n\r\n#### Family Members\r\n\r\nStudents have to declare all family members on their visa application, if not, these family members won\u2019t be able to travel to Australia to visit at a later stage.\r\n\r\nDHA require the financial details for the subsequent entry of family members. Not only for the person applying for the visa, but also including sufficient funds to cover their whole family unit in Australia. E.g. If my wife is on a Student visa in Australia and I apply to join her, DHA will look at the combined financial capacity for both my wife and my living expenses and also her course fees as well.\r\n\r\n#### Guardian Visas (Subclass 590)\r\n\r\nThe Student Guardian visa (Subcless 590) is for foreign nationals applying to stay in Australia as the guardian of an under 18 student.The student must not remain in Australia when their guardian is not in Australia unless there is an alternative welfare arrangement in place. In some special circumstances, guardian visas can be obtained to look after students who are over 18 years old.\r\n\r\nAll applicants for a Student Guardian visa must have sufficient funds to support themselves, the nominating student(s) and any secondary applicants for the duration of their intended stay in Australia.\r\n\r\nUnder the SSVF, the single immigration risk framework will not apply to Student Guardian visa applicants. Rather, all guardians must provide evidence of their financial capacity with their visa application.\r\n\r\nEvidence of financial capacity can be provided in either of the following forms:\r\n\r\n  * Evidence of annual income of $70,000 or more; or\r\n  * Evidence of sufficient funds to cover travel costs, and the first 12 months living costs for themselves and each dependent child included in the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent applications by family members of guardians will not be accepted. Guardians wishing to bring additional family members under six years of age to Australia must apply for a new Student Guardian visa for themselves and these students.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4746, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56bded43-ad8f-46d1-99bb-40d34f8d131f": {"__data__": {"id_": "56bded43-ad8f-46d1-99bb-40d34f8d131f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\\b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_name": "b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_size": 5194, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bde71043-e2ba-4bc9-9ae6-cc36a88e4cfc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\\b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_name": "b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_size": 5194, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c5bb1893b170343d7625f5c9576f29f17134d53a819b7b8c543103f2ad0ddacf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d50189b-c7a0-480d-a6db-8fce2b722871", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b8-student-visas-application-processes-specific-requirements-and-integrity-concerns\\b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_name": "b8-3-specific-requirements-in-particular-cases.md", "file_size": 5194, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "7248e941825c1b257ffef3c990889d25bd4678ca41e314bc73bd5a414ce58c99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In some special circumstances, guardian visas can be obtained to look after students who are over 18 years old.\r\n\r\nAll applicants for a Student Guardian visa must have sufficient funds to support themselves, the nominating student(s) and any secondary applicants for the duration of their intended stay in Australia.\r\n\r\nUnder the SSVF, the single immigration risk framework will not apply to Student Guardian visa applicants.

English language skills\r\n\r\nA visa applicant, who did not have the English language skills to meet the visa requirements, arranged for an impostor to sit the English language test on their behalf. DHA identified this fraud through (a) a facial comparison of the photo on the test results with another photo of the applicant; (b) an interview with the applicant which indicated a low level of English proficiency and (c) verification of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score online. While DHA has processes in place to detect and take action against English test fraud, education providers normally check off test results using the online verification tools available from the test providers.\r\n\r\n#### 2\\. Genuine student/temporary entrant\r\n\r\nA DHA case officer had to consider a Student visa application concerning an applicant from a country with high unemployment, who had strong family ties to Australia and who had not studied for a significant period of time. The case officer requested an interview with the applicant to obtain further information. At the interview, the applicant was unable to explain why he had chosen his proposed course and provider and how the course would benefit him. Given the applicant\u2019s low employment prospects in his country of origin, strong ties to Australia and the applicant\u2019s inability to provide basic information regarding his proposed course of study, the application was refused.\r\n\r\n#### 3\\. Family background and financial support\r\n\r\nA DHA case officer received an application in which the student\u2019s parents claimed to be in high-paying jobs in a reputable industry. The case officer requested an integrity check on the application as these claims were uncommon in the region from which the visa applicant came. The officer was able to identify that the student\u2019s parents did not have sufficient funds to contribute towards the student\u2019s expenses. The application was refused as the case officer was not satisfied the applicant had sufficient funds to support himself in his studies onshore and, therefore, was not planning to come to Australia with the genuine intention to study.\r\n\r\n#### 4\\. Document fraud\r\n\r\nAn overseas post identified an offshore website which claimed to be selling high quality forgeries of academic transcripts for use in migration applications.

These [visa conditions](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/see-your-visa-conditions?product=500) are often expressed as numbers.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Australian authorities do not require students to have a visa label in their passport. VEVO is a free online facility that allows Australian visa holders, employers, education providers, financial institutions and government agencies to check the visa details including conditions and entitlements of a visa holder. VEVO requires a registration and login. To check/verify the status of a student visa and its conditions, go to the [VEVO website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/check-conditions-online).\r\n\r\nIt is essential that every agent informs their students of the need to comply with their visa conditions. If a student does not comply, their visa may be cancelled and they may need to return home. There is also a three year ban (exclusion period) on re-entry to Australia if a visa is cancelled for breaching visa conditions.\r\n\r\nThe following table explains visa conditions that are relevant to most students, there are other visa conditions that may apply to the primary visa holder or their family members. This information will be included in the visa grant letter and also in VEVO. \r\n\r\n**Condition**| **Explanation**  \r\n---|---  \r\n8202| The student must maintain enrolment in a full-time registered course that provides a qualification at the same or higher level than the course which the visa was granted to, and satisfy their provider\u2019s requirements for attendance and course progress.  \r\n8501| The student must maintain adequate health insurance during the time they are in Australia.  \r\n8516| The student\u2019s must continue to satisfy the requirements for the grant of the student visa. For example, a student must continue to have sufficient financial funds to support their study and stay in Australia.  \r\n8517| The student visa holder must maintain adequate arrangements for the education of any school-age dependant who is in Australia for more than 3 months.  \r\n8532| If the student is under 18, he or she must maintain welfare arrangements with either a parent, close relative or legal custodian or if welfare is approved through the education provider the education provider must approve arrangements including when arrangements change.  \r\n8533| The student must keep the education institution informed of their current address in Australia. They have 7 days to notify them of any changes.  \r\n8534| The student will not be eligible to lodge a new visa application in Australia and must return to their home country first, unless exceptional circumstances apply.  \r\n8535| The student will not be eligible to lodge a new visa application in Australia and must return to their home country, unless the applicant gives evidence, in writing, that the Commonwealth or the government of the foreign country, as the case requires, does not oppose the applicant undertaking a further course of study.  \r\n8105| The student cannot work more than 48 hours per fortnight when their course is in session (other than work which has been registered as a part of the course). No work limits apply during recognised periods of vacation offered by the education provider. No work limits apply for Postgraduate Research students (subclass 574) once their course has commenced.  \r\n8104| The student\u2019s family member, who was included in the primary applicant\u2019s (i.e. Student visa holder) application and was granted a visa, can work up to 48 hours per fortnight.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4356, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0c68e09-2a6e-430e-8294-add2c26d18e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0c68e09-2a6e-430e-8294-add2c26d18e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_name": "b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_size": 5303, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d45bb7f-ec78-4056-9437-474d0cd9182c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_name": "b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_size": 5303, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "5932cf5728e41f3f6e489f369ec14f31220a8327b2dd0fced446c912d1383d08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "00e4f393-857a-405c-865e-08658970b04b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_name": "b9-1-visa-conditions.md", "file_size": 5303, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "721100ef13941c83a40b3c730fc1fffd002a3695fdf0cc5719f1841d290a4d4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8535| The student will not be eligible to lodge a new visa application in Australia and must return to their home country, unless the applicant gives evidence, in writing, that the Commonwealth or the government of the foreign country, as the case requires, does not oppose the applicant undertaking a further course of study.  \r\n8105| The student cannot work more than 48 hours per fortnight when their course is in session (other than work which has been registered as a part of the course).

If this does not happen, then:\r\n\r\n  * The education provider will have documented policies and procedures stating whether they will consider compassionate and compelling circumstances;\r\n  * The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. The letter must also inform the student they have 20 working days within which to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce this timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalised and found in favour of the provider, the provider reports the breach of the student visa condition using PRISMS.\r\n\r\nThe student will then receive a notice informing them that they must attend at an Immigration office within 28 days. Should they not do this, their visa may be cancelled.\r\n\r\n#### Academic performance\r\n\r\nA student must achieve satisfactory academic results. However, often an institution cannot immediately exclude the student for failure and so the student continues on their Student visa. In this situation the student needs to follow the relevant appeal process. If the appeal is unsuccessful, then:\r\n\r\n  * The education provider must have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory course progress;\r\n  * The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. The letter must also inform the student they have 20 working days within which to access the provider\u2019s complaints and appeals process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce this timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalised and found in favour of the provider; the provider reports the visa breach using PRISMS.\r\n\r\n#### Current address\r\n\r\nThe student must keep the education provider informed of their current address in Australia. This is because all formal notices are sent to this address. If the address changes, the student must inform the education provider within 7 days.\r\n\r\nAn under 18 student must have the approval of their education provider to move to another address if they are not living with a parent, guardian or relative.\r\n\r\n#### Changing courses and institutions\r\n\r\n##### _Changing Course_\r\n\r\nIf a student wants to stay at the same institution but wants to change courses with the same AQF level they will not require a new student visa. \r\n\r\nIf the new course is longer than the original course, the student should apply for a further Student visa before their visa expires. If a student wishes to undertake a shorter course than that for which the visa was granted, when they have completed the shorter course they must, within 28 days, either depart Australia or, if they wish to enrol in a further course of study, notify DHA and apply for a new student visa if it is required.\r\n\r\nA student must remain enrolled in a course at the same or higher AQF level for which their visa has been granted (unless changing from AQF 10 to AQF 9). If the student wishes to change to a lower level program, they should apply for a new Student visa.

Unless special circumstances apply, they are required to have the permission of the existing education provider (through a letter of release) in order to transfer to another education provider.\r\n\r\nThe education provider must assess a request to transfer a student and all education providers have documented procedures on their transfer policy. Agents should make sure they understand their education provider\u2019s transfer policy, and the written agreement with the student, before attempting to enrol a student with a new education provider.\r\n\r\nIf an education provider does not give permission to transfer to another education provider and the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the process, they should first access the internal appeal process with the education provider. If still not satisfied, they can appeal the education provider\u2019s decision at an external complaints handling body, such as the State or Territory Ombudsman or the Overseas Student Ombudsman.\r\n\r\nIf the student has completed six months of the principal course, no permission from the current institution is required.\r\n\r\nIn cases where students have been granted a student visa based on streamlined evidentiary requirements and they change to a provider that may have otherwise required regular evidentiary requirements, DHA may request evidence of financial capacity and English proficiency from the student. \r\n\r\n#### Travel\r\n\r\nStudents can enter and leave Australia as often as necessary while they have a current student visa. Students must check that their passport will not expire while they are outside of Australia.\r\n\r\nIf they obtain a new passport after they have already got a student visa, they must inform DHA of the new passport details before they travel overseas.\r\n\r\nIf an under 18 student has their welfare arrangements approved by their education provider, they will not be able to travel to Australia until the date their provider nominated as the start date for the approved arrangements.\r\n\r\n#### Duration of visa\r\n\r\nThe visa has an expiry date.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a student who is under the age of 18 whose welfare arrangements are being approved by their education provider, the expiry date of the visa will be in accordance with the end of the students approved welfare arrangements as indicated on the students CAAW.\r\n\r\n#### An expired visa\r\n\r\nIf a student\u2019s visa expires and they are still in Australia without having any other visas, they become \u201cunlawful\u201d and should contact DHA immediately.\r\n\r\nIf they do not contact DHA within 28 days after the expiry date, they will not be eligible for the grant of most types of visas, including a further Student visa in Australia and may then be subject to a risk factor called an \u2018Exclusion Period\u2019.\r\n\r\nAn exclusion period prevents a person from being granted certain visas, including student visas, for a period of three years after last departing Australia unless certain circumstances apply.\r\n\r\n#### A cancelled visa\r\n\r\nSimilar to an expired visa, if a student\u2019s visa is cancelled in Australia, they will not be eligible for the grant of most types of visas, including a further Student visa in Australia and may then be subject to an \u2018Exclusion Period\u2019.", "mimetype":

As a result, student visa holders (and their family members travelling with them) do not need to apply for permission to work separately once they arrive in Australia.\r\n\r\nAs of July 1, 2023, student visa holders can work up to 48 hours per fortnight while their course is in session and can work unlimited hours during recognized school breaks.\r\n\r\n**_NOTE: There are temporary work rights that should be included in this section, see:<https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/temporary-relaxation-of-working-hours-for-student-visa-holders>_**\r\n\r\nA student\u2019s course is considered to be \u2018in session\u2019:\r\n\r\n  * for the duration of the advertised semesters (including periods when exams are being held);\r\n  * if the studies have been completed but the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is still in effect, and\r\n  * if a student is undertaking another course during a break from their main course and the points will be credited towards their main course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The student cannot undertake work until they have commenced their course in Australia. DHA considers work to also include some volunteer work or unpaid work. If a student is doing voluntary, unpaid work, it is not included in the limit of 48 hours per fortnight if it:\r\n\r\n  * is of benefit to the community\r\n  * is for a non-profit organisation\r\n  * would not otherwise be undertaken in return for wages by an Australian resident (that is, it is a designated volunteer position), and\r\n  * is genuinely voluntary (that is, no remuneration, either in cash or kind is received, \u2013 board and lodging acceptable).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese conditions do not apply to work that is required as part of a student\u2019s course. The educational institution will advise a student if this is the case.\r\n\r\n##### _Dependent of the student holder_\r\n\r\nA dependent of a student visa holder is subject to condition 8104 which permits the holder to work a maximum of 48 hours per fortnight once the student (main applicant) has commenced their course. If the student\u2019s course of study is a course for the award of a masters or doctorate degree that is registered on CRICOS, a dependent may work unlimited hours.\r\n\r\n##### _Helping students understand their rights at work_\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government is committed to helping protect international students during their time in Australia, including in workplaces. To make sure that international students are treated fairly at work, including being paid the right amount and on time, students need to know what rights they have in Australian workplaces.\r\n\r\nA website is available for education agents with tools and resources to help students have a positive experience in Australia\r\n\r\n<https://www.fairwork.gov.au/internationalstudents>\r\n\r\nAfter reading through the site, answer the following questions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4008, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d37351d-9ac5-4082-9003-0ae844e9d148": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d37351d-9ac5-4082-9003-0ae844e9d148", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_name": "b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_size": 4444, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5bc92f3f-7e6b-4ee9-94d5-d4655f633665", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_name": "b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_size": 4444, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "d29223bf34b0100c27b0bde6637e1da45fb246e5b0dd92e43cfd56d91a6938d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43a0af20-403c-4a7f-9827-a916b0a5b06e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_name": "b9-3-work-rights-for-students.md", "file_size": 4444, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "0558e2da2b644ff3493aaed8d4b4caf4a36e47e6a06c86c0902dd9e94ba7a88e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "##### _Dependent of the student holder_\r\n\r\nA dependent of a student visa holder is subject to condition 8104 which permits the holder to work a maximum of 48 hours per fortnight once the student (main applicant) has commenced their course.

A student visa entitles a person to come to Australia on a temporary basis for a specified period to undertake study at an Australian educational institution. While many overseas students make a decision to apply for permanent residence upon completing their studies, this is an entirely separate process and there is no guarantee that, on the basis of having held a student visa, a person will meet the requirements to be granted permanent residence.\r\n\r\nThere is the opportunity for graduating students who meet particular criteria to stay in Australia and work temporarily. The information that follows is a summary and you should refer to the [DHA website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-finder) for further detail.\r\n\r\n#### Temporary Graduate Visa (subclass 485)\r\n\r\nIn order to remain in Australia after studies, a student can obtain a Temporary Graduate visa. This visa has two streams: the Graduate Work stream and the Post-Study Work stream.\r\n\r\nThe Graduate Work stream is the same as the previous Skilled Graduate visa (subclass 485) for international students who have recently graduated with skills and qualifications that relate to an occupation on Australia\u2019s Skilled Occupation List (SOL). The duration of this visa is typically 18 months, but it can be extended for certain graduates.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Study Work stream offers extended options for working in Australia to eligible graduates of a higher education degree. Under this stream, successful applicants are granted a visa of two, three or four years duration, depending on the highest educational qualification they have obtained.\r\n\r\nAs of March 23, 2024, significant changes were made to the Temporary Graduate visa:\r\n\r\n  * The age limit for applicants has been reduced from 50 years to 35 years.\r\n  * The English language proficiency requirement has been increased for applications lodged on or after this date.\r\n  * There are provisions allowing for additional time on the visa for graduates from regional institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Australian study requirement_**\r\n\r\nAll subclass 485 visa applicants must meet the Australian study requirement in the six months immediately prior to making their application, regardless of the stream that they are assessed under.\r\n\r\nStudents must have:\r\n\r\n  * attained either a single qualification requiring at least two academic years study or multiple qualifications resulting in a total period of at least two academic years study;\r\n  * undertaken this study in no less than 16 months;\r\n  * lodged their application within six months of completing their course (when they received their results not the Graduation ceremony).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo meet this requirement, the course/courses must also:\r\n\r\n  * be on CRICOS\r\n  * have been successfully completed\r\n  * have resulted in an eligible qualification\r\n  * have had all instruction in English\r\n  * have been completed while physically in Australia\r\n  * have been completed while holding a visa allowing study in Australia be counted only once towards the Australian study requirement.\r\n  * not be an English language proficiency course or enabling program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo academic years study is defined as 92 weeks of study in a course or courses registered by CRICOS. CRICOS defines a number of weeks for each course. Students may take longer to complete their course, but will only be credited with the number of weeks that CRICOS determines as a standard duration. Only study that is successfully completed counts towards the two academic years. Students may meet the two year academic study requirement when completing a course that is longer than two years.\r\n\r\nCredits for prior learning may reduce the amount of study undertaken. Credit granted on the basis of study undertaken in Australia in a course registered with CRICOS may contribute towards meeting the Australian study requirement, but only once.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4669, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1fed746-f606-41e3-8650-7bfcab1697e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1fed746-f606-41e3-8650-7bfcab1697e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_name": "b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_size": 8295, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13f5370b-28c9-4d8b-88a4-99e24a7c6b26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_name": "b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_size": 8295, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "1552d5b0267b428a87b2f4afd85dca7f80d05807f576853992c265cab6386f03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aafd0679-f7be-4b81-866d-b2e656165b81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_name": "b9-4-visas-following-study.md", "file_size": 8295, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "3725e3f6a0abeb78a6fd4c012e89327bd1f967cfcf27f8ad9249dcb8de80ee3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "* not be an English language proficiency course or enabling program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo academic years study is defined as 92 weeks of study in a course or courses registered by CRICOS.

A visa in this stream is granted for 18 months.\r\n\r\nEligible qualifications can be a degree, diploma or trade qualification and the qualifications must be closely related to the student\u2019s nominated skilled occupation. This means the subject matter and the skills gained from the qualifications can be applied at the level achieved in the nominated skilled occupation.\r\n\r\nExample: Acceptable combinations of study and nominated occupations include:\r\n\r\n  * an applicant who nominates \u2018Physiotherapist\u2019 as their skilled occupation and completes a degree in physiotherapy in Australia\r\n  * an applicant who nominates \u2018Air-conditioning and Mechanical Services Plumber\u2019 as their skilled occupation who has completed a Certificate III in Plumbing and a Diploma of Plumbing and Services in Australia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: A combination of study and nominated occupation that would not be acceptable:\r\n\r\n  * An applicant\u2019s nominated occupation is Registered Nurse but they completed a Bachelor of Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the Skilled Occupations List (SOL) changes regularly and occupations that may have been listed when a student commenced their course, may no longer be on the list when they graduate.\r\n\r\n#### Post-study work stream\r\n\r\nFor international students with an eligible qualification. A visa in this stream is granted for 2-4 years. Eligible qualifications:\r\n\r\n  * Bachelor degree (2 years work rights)\r\n  * Bachelor (honours) degree (2 years work rights)\r\n  * Masters by coursework degree (2 years work rights)\r\n  * Masters (extended) degree (2 years work rights)\r\n  * Masters by research degree (3 years work rights)\r\n  * Doctoral degree. (4 years work rights)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Study resulting in a diploma level qualification or trade qualification is NOT eligible.\r\n\r\nAll courses must have been undertaken at an Australian university or education provider accredited to offer degree level programs.\r\n\r\n#### Migrate to Australia under the General Skilled Migration (GSM)\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that student visas are aimed at achieving an educational outcome. General Skilled Migration (GSM) on the other hand is predominantly driven by the labour market needs of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for grant of GSM visas can change in response to the changing economic circumstances of Australia. All applicants seeking to be granted a permanent GSM visa must meet the relevant criteria set out in the Migration legislation, regardless of whether or not they have previously been in Australia. It is important for student visa holders to note that any changes to the criteria for the grant of a GSM visa would not affect their Student visa conditions.\r\n\r\nNote: If you are an agent working in Australia, you must be a Registered Migration Agent (RMA) to provide immigration advice.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ B9.4 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-4-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-4-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3849, "end_char_idx": 8279, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d60bb9ef-d49c-4fe5-a84b-287469396a48": {"__data__": {"id_": "d60bb9ef-d49c-4fe5-a84b-287469396a48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia.md", "file_name": "b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia.md", "file_size": 4143, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f41d9586-2d0e-4192-a09a-8f66705be337", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia.md", "file_name": "b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia.md", "file_size": 4143, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "e91e9903ad53ff4b0e4840208420c8339b9c76c569f45b4c645596b9a2d895ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\r\ntopic_slug: b9-5-immigration-advice-from-education-agents-in-australia\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B9.5 Immigration Advice from Education Agents in Australia\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [B9.

This is because of the large number of visa types and the frequent changing of visa regulations and conditions. So, education agents who are not RMAs are not equipped to understand the factors that impact on an individual\u2019s migration plans.\r\n\r\nEducation agents in Australia who are not RMAs should not attempt to:\r\n\r\n  * Case manage a student\u2019s application for permanent residence,\r\n  * Provide any detailed analysis of a student\u2019s migration pathway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a criminal offence **in Australia** to give immigration advice if an individual is not an RMA.\r\n\r\nYou need to put a student in contact with a Registered Migration Agent as quickly as possible if:\r\n\r\n  * The student is having significant difficulty in complying with their visa conditions, or\r\n  * The student has received a notice of visa breach.  \r\nAny appeal needs to be lodged within a strict time limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find RMAs in Australia or overseas please refer to the [Office of the ](https://www.mara.gov.au/search-the-register-of-migration-agents/)[Migration Agents Registration Authority](https://www.mara.gov.au/search-the-register-of-migration-agents/) search page.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ B9.5 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-5-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-4-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/b9-5-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4133, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f753963c-8fe5-436c-922d-59a87f8b4399": {"__data__": {"id_": "f753963c-8fe5-436c-922d-59a87f8b4399", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md", "file_name": "b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md", "file_size": 3024, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3515b29-fa23-4eca-b911-01beba3a8fd1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\\b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md", "file_name": "b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities.md", "file_size": 3024, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "13f09ab961876401e346dd278c3419046408c2488c71135800e79ad84f1dcf7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: b9-student-visas-visa-conditions-and-student-responsibilities\r\n---\r\n\r\n# B9.

Some examples are shown below:\r\n\r\n**TYPE OF RECRUITMENT**| **FEATURES**  \r\n---|---  \r\nExhibitions| The institution is represented and applications are processed through an agency. If the institution is present, application fees are usually \u2018waived\u2019 (that is, the application fee does not need to be paid).  \r\nInterviews| A representative from the institution holds interview sessions at an agent\u2019s office. Application fees are often waived in this situation.  \r\nWalk-In| A student visits your agency through either an advertising campaign or word of mouth referral.  \r\nLinks / Alliances| Sometimes an overseas institution has an agreement (eg. articulation, twinning or study abroad) with an Australian or overseas institution. In this situation a particular agency may be promoted as the preferred application route.  \r\n  \r\nDuring this stage of the process a student is advised on their different study options including institutions, programs, costs and locations.\r\n\r\n### Application and Letter of Offer\r\n\r\nAfter understanding their study options, the student needs to submit an application form.\r\n\r\nThe required documents for an international student\u2019s application usually include:\r\n\r\n  * Certified copies of their**academic history** to date, including high school results, university results and awards;\r\n  * Certified copies of their **English Language proficiency** (eg. IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic, CAE or evidence that their medium of instruction has been English);\r\n  * Certified copies of **ID** (e.g. passport)\r\n  * For research study, a copy of their research proposal may also be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to decide how many applications to send and to which institutions. This is a judgement for an agency to make as policy. It might be preferable to send a small number of applications as best practice because:\r\n\r\n  * For the student this will provide a choice of programs at different institutions.\r\n  * For the institutions, it is likely they will be more supportive of you if they receive a small number of applications that convert to enrolments rather than receiving and processing a large number of applications with few conversions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution will reply to a student\u2019s application in one of four ways:\r\n\r\n**REPLY TO APPLICATION**| **DETAILS**  \r\n---|---  \r\nA Rejection letter| This indicates the student does not meet entry requirements for that program at that specific institution.  \r\nA Conditional Offer letter| This is a request for additional information. For example, the offer may be conditional on the student providing certified copies of their documents or conditional on undertaking further English language training. You would need to contact the student to supply the additional information required.

The letter would explain that if a student successfully fulfilled certain conditions during their Foundation Program, they would then be given direct entry into a degree program.  \r\n  \r\n### Payment and Confirmation of Enrolment\r\n\r\nA Full Offer (or Package Offer) letter is often accompanied by a letter of acceptance. If the student wishes to accept the offer, they need to sign this document and then you would return it with a copy of the payment (e.g. copy of international bank transfer or credit card authorisation form) to the institution.\r\n\r\nThe payment required usually consists of:\r\n\r\n  * tuition fees for the program (usually the first semester);\r\n  * Overseas Student Health Cover (single or family).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce payment is confirmed a student is issued with an electronic Confirmation of Enrolment Form.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the institution would issue this and then forward it, via the agent, to the student.  \r\nIn some cases the institution may have authorised an agent to create CoEs on their behalf. This CoE is then being checked by the institution staff and if found correct, authorised by them. The agent then prints out the authorised CoE.\r\n\r\nWith a valid CoE all students at all Assessment levels can apply for a Student visa at their local Australian High Commission or Australian Embassy. \r\n\r\n### Student Visa Application and Grant\r\n\r\nOnce the student has a CoE, an application for a student visa needs to be processed. This involves:\r\n\r\n  * Filling out the application form.\r\n  * Gathering supporting documentation such as:  \r\n\u2013 Evidence of financial support  \r\n\u2013 English language proficiency  \r\n\u2013 Academic qualifications and  \r\n\u2013 Other documentation as required.\r\n  * Completion of health checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication checklists can be found on [DHA\u2019s website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/web-evidentiary-tool).\r\n\r\n### Pre-Departure Briefing\r\n\r\nA pre-departure briefing should be organised before students leave their home country. This briefing should cover all areas of a students stay in Australia and should provide realistic expectations of a student\u2019s life in Australia.\r\n\r\nStudents need to be aware of:\r\n\r\n  * Visa conditions\r\n  * Reception procedures\r\n  * A list of contacts for their arrival\r\n  * Facilities\r\n  * Cultural briefing\r\n  * Student support services\r\n  * Accommodation options and\r\n  * Other relevant topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C3.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c3-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c3-student-client-management/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c3-student-client-management/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c3-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3802, "end_char_idx": 7377, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f673c3e5-516b-460d-894d-77fcd905484d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f673c3e5-516b-460d-894d-77fcd905484d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c3-student-client-management\\c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md", "file_name": "c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md", "file_size": 7228, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2464fb3c-1091-46fa-a581-05d484c5d666", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c3-student-client-management\\c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md", "file_name": "c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia.md", "file_size": 7228, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "a5e401ba9f1ba359c7e8cd9f66534cc97e4f220bc068812ebd09ebd3538fec85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa5171ca-630b-4a04-a168-1a41d7541165", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b044db802bddc00edd5a5d8ac577ce0b62fc216d7067872f378259b146a3d47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c3-student-client-management\r\ntopic_slug: c3-2-after-arriving-in-australia\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C3.2 After Arriving in Australia\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C3.

Some examples are given below.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-oleksandr-pidvalnyi-1008155-1024x681.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Airport Pickup** :\r\n\r\n  * You can arrange for an institutional representative to pick up your students from the airport on their arrival. They then can be taken to temporary or permanent accommodation.\r\n  * The airport pick-up fee is usually payable before arrival. Also, the education provider must have a record of the student\u2019s flight details so that the representative is given the correct information about the student\u2019s arrival (especially if the flight is delayed or arrives ahead of schedule).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Accommodation** :\r\n\r\n  * **Temporary accommodation**  \r\n\u2013 can be provided to international students until they find something more permanent. This type of accommodation is ideal for students when they first arrive, so they can eventually decide where they would like to live for a longer period of time.\r\n  * **Homestay**  \r\n\u2013 is a common option for high school or ELICOS students and involves staying with an Australian family in their house. Terms vary but most homestay accommodation includes breakfast and dinner.\r\n  * **On-campus accommodation**  \r\n\u2013 is available at many education providers that have residences in the form of residential colleges or boarding houses. These usually have to be pre-booked before a student\u2019s arrival in Australia.\r\n  * **Off-campus accommodation**  \r\n\u2013 can be arranged after a student\u2019s arrival in Australia and is usually arranged independently of the education provider. Forms of off-campus accommodation include: rental houses or units, student residences operated by private organisations and student units or houses operated by private organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other information** :\r\n\r\n  * International students on reception in Australia may also receive information about opening bank accounts, the local environment, and orientation dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Orientation and Admission\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-photomix-company-518244-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nEach education provider will organise a student orientation before students commence their course. Orientation usually showcases the services and activities available to students during their study including academic planning advice, student support services, clubs and societies, and health care.\r\n\r\nNote that universities can advise students to \u2018enrol\u2019 during the orientation period. Having a CoE means that the student has been accepted into the study program. They must then select subjects and tutorials at this time to finalise their study program.\r\n\r\n### Course Begins\r\n\r\nOnce a semester commences there are two possible scenarios:\r\n\r\n**1\\. The Student withdraws**\r\n\r\n**\u200b** There are many reasons why this happens such as:\r\n\r\n  * They are unhappy at the education provider or location they originally chose\r\n  * They are homesick\r\n  * A family crisis means they have to return home\r\n  * *Their original course is inappropriate or\r\n  * *They find a faster or better program of study that meets their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_*Note that agents are expected to recommend appropriate courses to students. It is considered unethical to place a student in a course known to be inappropriate in order to collect a commission. This behaviour is also a breach of the National Code 2018, Standard 4.6._\r\n\r\nThe student may decide to return home or enrol in another education provider.

If the student does not enrol in another course, the **student visa will be cancelled**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the student wishes to enrol in another education provider:\r\n\r\n  * they must have a **letter of release** from the original provider and an **evidence of a full offer** from the new education provider.\r\n  * DHA requires that a student will not be considered for a transfer for the first 6 months of their principal course unless there are clear grounds for this.\r\n  * if the initial course was eligible for SVP and the proposed new course is not, the student\u2019s visa may be cancelled based on the combined evidence of the student\u2019s new education provider and country of citizenship.\r\n  * the agent can collect their commission from the new provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**2\\. Student starts their studies**\r\n\r\nIf a student starts their studies in their chosen program, you can invoice the education provider for your commission (as per the terms of your agency agreement with an education provider).\r\n\r\n### Advice for student crises\r\n\r\nDuring their course of study a student may come to you for advice concerning crises such as these:\r\n\r\n  * **Medical** \u2013 an accident, or serious illness\r\n  * **Financial** \u2013 student is unable to pay for their studies\r\n  * **Visa** **compliance** \u2013 the student has breached the conditions of their visa\r\n  * **Family** \u2013 some family matter has involved the student or\r\n  * **Academic** \u2013 the student has difficulties succeeding in their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most cases an agent can only:\r\n\r\n  * advise the student of their options\r\n  * liaise with family members in their home country if appropriate and/or\r\n  * redirect family members to sources of support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if a student has been excluded from an education provider on academic grounds, you can refer them to the relevant contacts (such as student support services) for advice on available appeal procedures.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C3.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c3-2-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c3-1-check-your-knowledge-2/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c3-student-client-management/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c3-2-check-your-knowledge-2/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3663, "end_char_idx": 7188, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b26498e2-9e8e-4354-87de-e7edefb7f8a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b26498e2-9e8e-4354-87de-e7edefb7f8a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c3-student-client-management\\c3-3-after-completing-course.md", "file_name": "c3-3-after-completing-course.md", "file_size": 2076, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8ffd61b-c503-4eb4-ad15-c1cfb5b18b06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c3-student-client-management\\c3-3-after-completing-course.md", "file_name": "c3-3-after-completing-course.md", "file_size": 2076, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "60530cc9c89c952306234edb90d5b103b69bc9598e3b8a111d050182115c9193", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c3-3-after-completing-course/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c3-student-client-management\r\ntopic_slug: c3-3-after-completing-course\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C3.3 After Completing the Course\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C3.

How they organise these depends on the size of the provider and the educational sector.\r\n\r\nResources might include:\r\n\r\n  * specialised staff\r\n  * a student support office\r\n  * a communication system to let students and staff know where help may be found and\r\n  * physical facilities such as student drop-in centres, lounges and information boards placed in locations where students gather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Facilities and services\r\n\r\nPastoral care facilities are varied in the way they are managed and who manages them. Universities, colleges and schools have student support staff who are located in student support units, and within faculties and departments.\r\n\r\nA University Student Union, Guild or Student Association provides facilities for specific groups of students, including legal advice, health services and student clubs and organisations, which offer support and networking opportunities for new and continuing students. Often the student organisations have their own office and provide informal advice for students.\r\n\r\nIt is common for universities, colleges and schools to provide prayer rooms and specially allocated places for religious observance, in recognition that international students are from many faiths.\r\n\r\nAn indirect way pastoral care is managed by education providers is the encouragement of \u2018campus life\u2019, which covers the whole experience students have when they come to university or school. Campus life includes activities, sports, meetings, festivals, events and networks. Students should be advised that being involved in campus life is an excellent way to be responsible for their own pastoral care.\r\n\r\n### Accommodation\r\n\r\nPastoral care services are often located with residential facilities, so that students can access help after hours. Many residential colleges have a person employed to assist students.\r\n\r\nWhen living in rental accommodation students should be encouraged to locate the nearest services such as doctors when they settle in. Many, but not all homestay carers will assist students to find the best pastoral care at school or in the community.\r\n\r\nA few examples of overseas student services by Australian education providers:\r\n\r\n  * [International Student Services](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international) \u2013 QUT\r\n  * [International Student Support Services](https://www.utas.edu.au/international/the-tasmanian-experience/facilities-and-support) \u2013 UTAS\r\n  * [Student Support ](https://tafeqld.edu.au/current-students/student-support-services/index.html)\u2013 TAFE Queensland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C4.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c4-pastoral-care-issues/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c4-pastoral-care-issues/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-1-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3730, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7169e86d-bf5e-476d-b7d3-ec67de01b8a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7169e86d-bf5e-476d-b7d3-ec67de01b8a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-2-people.md", "file_name": "c4-2-people.md", "file_size": 7355, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4be4904e-4f31-4218-ab6c-d896c159674a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-2-people.md", "file_name": "c4-2-people.md", "file_size": 7355, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "c15506dc5ecfc106c469e53e7fd8dfe87740593dff23fad1dea8f6e83f2119d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7871bfbe-8843-476d-8aaf-38f3b5d70d8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf9753246755c5d15cdc77205c9b02affebedc7fbb49e3c4830ee4b5deab4e08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-2-people/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c4-pastoral-care-issues\r\ntopic_slug: c4-2-people\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C4.2 People\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C4.

This includes appointing staff that are specialists in counselling and advising international students, who are located either in faculties, departments or in special student support offices.\r\n\r\nIn secondary schools, these support people may also be teaching staff with additional responsibilities. \r\n\r\nStudents should be encouraged to:\r\n\r\n  * seek help from specialised staff as soon as they think they need it and\r\n  * take the opportunity to learn about living and studying in Australia before and after they arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA range of support is provided by:\r\n\r\n  * International student advisers\r\n  * Student counsellors\r\n  * Support specialists\r\n  * Learning and language support personnel\r\n  * Student organisations\r\n  * Accommodation officers\r\n  * Community support personnel\r\n  * Law enforcement workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### International Student Advisers\r\n\r\nAn International Student Adviser has a range of responsibilities and often provides the first point of contact for students seeking advice on a range of matters. The responsibilities might include:\r\n\r\n  * Welcoming new students at orientation programs\r\n  * Planning and delivering activities and events for students\r\n  * Developing student support programs, including peer support\r\n  * Preparing information for students to assist them with questions\r\n  * Discussion with individual students in relation to their student experience\r\n  * Referring students to relevant services and specialised support\r\n  * Liaising with external bodies such as DIBP, and community groups\r\n  * Communicating with and supporting student organisations\r\n  * Providing advice to faculty staff about the specific needs of international students\r\n  * Providing individual advice and support for students about: \r\n    * Settling into accommodation\r\n    * Cultural adjustment\r\n    * Academic progress\r\n    * Where to find appropriate services \r\n    * Basic information about visa compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Student counsellors\r\n\r\nStudent Counsellors may be the same people as International Student Advisers, but generally a counsellor is a person specialised in psychological welfare, mental health and sometimes cross-cultural issues.\r\n\r\nStudents are encouraged to seek help from counsellors, as these people are trained to maintain students\u2019 confidentiality, and have special skills. Australian students are familiar with the role of a counsellor and often find that talking over personal problems is a very good way to solve issues.\r\n\r\nWithin universities counsellors are also informed about language, learning and health issues, and can refer students to the right person for their needs.\r\n\r\n### Support specialists\r\n\r\nMany large providers employ specialist support staff to help students with disabilities and other issues. Universities are obliged to provide this kind of support.\r\n\r\nStudents should be advised to talk to their Enrolment Officer or International Student Adviser before they enrol, or when they arrive if they think they will need assistance with a disability.

In most large institutions there will be Accommodation Officers who can assist and advise students with these common problems:\r\n\r\n  * Signing a residential lease and not understanding the language on the documents\r\n  * Being responsible for bills when a house-mate moves out\r\n  * Finding communication difficult with house-mates\r\n  * Being unfamiliar with appropriate and acceptable behaviour when dealing with others\r\n  * Having responsibility for large sums of money, including fees\r\n  * Finding that part-time work does not sufficiently help with costs\r\n  * Balancing education and part-time work responsibilities\r\n  * Being unaware of rights as employees in part-time jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Community support personnel\r\n\r\nAlong with special staff in universities colleges and schools, many support personnel in the community can provide services to students. These include:\r\n\r\n  * Health professionals (eg. doctors, dentists, psychologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists)\r\n  * Counsellors\r\n  * Religious groups and churches\r\n  * Municipal support (eg. town councils)\r\n  * Ethnic and cultural groups\r\n  * Consulates \r\n  * National-based associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Law enforcement workers\r\n\r\nStudents may find the laws and regulations in Australia very different from their home countries. However, students should understand that laws relating to safety, security, privacy and protection are intended to ensure that people\u2019s rights are protected.\r\n\r\nIf a student witnesses a crime or is a victim of a crime, then the police should be contacted. Most Australian States have police units, which specialise in crime and public safety issues relating to immigrant groups and international students. Students should be confident in trusting police to deal with safety and security issues.\r\n\r\nSecurity staff at many large colleges and universities are trained to help international students when in trouble or when they feel their security is threatened. Students who report threats, crimes, or any other issues to security staff, police, or staff at their education institution have the right to have these issues kept confidential.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C4.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c4-pastoral-care-issues/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3907, "end_char_idx": 7349, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cf43eaf-b78b-4481-95f4-f93fc47d4b4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cf43eaf-b78b-4481-95f4-f93fc47d4b4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-3-programs.md", "file_name": "c4-3-programs.md", "file_size": 7626, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b16b36b-b45d-4f57-a129-b32e04d3d1d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-3-programs.md", "file_name": "c4-3-programs.md", "file_size": 7626, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "b2ddae7b9ac22fd8a2243e9b66db071ef76c66c024c81d9d8b97cae618ce465a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd073599-7568-4c2b-b87a-ab2f7bcfd607", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d404dc461a6e437c97d4a7c113645c8e53e959068472e3b8290085c37d6b7706", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-3-programs/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c4-pastoral-care-issues\r\ntopic_slug: c4-3-programs\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C4.3 Programs\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C4.

Students generally are most interested in the pre-arrival and on-arrival information they receive at these briefings, so information should be focused on practical information relating to:\r\n\r\n  * settling in\r\n  * finding accommodation \r\n  * what to expect in a new country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following areas need to be considered in a pre-departure briefing:\r\n\r\n**What students need to know before they leave their home country**|  Students should be encouraged to use a checklist that has information about:\r\n\r\n  * The climate in the area they will be studying\r\n  * The local environment, community, campus\r\n  * What to pack\r\n  * Preparing for a homestay experience\r\n  * Preparing for independent living\r\n  * Telephone and internet access\r\n  * What the school, college, university can provide before arrival\r\n  * What to expect in the classroom\r\n  * Relationships\r\n  * Emotional preparation\r\n  * Safety and security\r\n  * Who the student should contact with problems or for information\r\n  * The documents that should be carried, read and understood\r\n  * Airport reception and what to do if the pickup does not arrive.\r\n\r\n  \r\n---|---  \r\n**Possible questions from student and their families**|  Many parents attend pre-departure briefings with their students. Parents often have questions about safety, security and supervision of younger students.  \r\n**Asking senior students to help with pre-departure**|  Students who have completed a year or two of their Australian studies (and who are home for vacation) can be useful in providing first-hand information to students who are preparing to study in Australia for the first time.  \r\n**Preparing interactive online presentations and resources**|  Online and interactive presentations are worth considering if students are unable to attend briefings. Monash University, for example, has pre-departure information on their [website](http://www.monash.edu/study/international/prepare/australia.html).  \r\n**What students need to know on arrival**|  Most education providers send detailed on-arrival information to students before they arrive. This may include:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * How to use public transport\r\n  * Currency, banking, shopping\r\n  * How to contact the school, college or university\r\n  * Dates of enrolment, orientation, commencement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Orientation\r\n\r\nOrientation programs are a regular part of the international student support process. Providers develop and deliver these in a range of formats according to the number of students, and the time of intake into courses.\r\n\r\nOrientation programs for large universities are often published on the university\u2019s website to inform students what is available to them. Other providers send orientation information with the CoE and most will have this information available upon request.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that all students attend orientation programs to:\r\n\r\n  * Receive a formal welcome to the school, college or university\r\n  * Receive vital information about the new study environment\r\n  * Have course and enrolment information explained\r\n  * Be informed about campus life and facilities such as banking and public transport\r\n  * Have specialised staff available to discuss accommodation options and issues\r\n  * Be informed about language and learning support\r\n  * Be informed about visa compliance obligations\r\n  * Meet new friends, teachers and international student advisers\r\n  * Become familiar with the library resources and research facilities\r\n  * Understand what is expected of them as an independent learner in Australia\r\n  * Have campus tours\r\n  * Enjoy a range of social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mentoring\r\n\r\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4508, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd073599-7568-4c2b-b87a-ab2f7bcfd607": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd073599-7568-4c2b-b87a-ab2f7bcfd607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-3-programs.md", "file_name": "c4-3-programs.md", "file_size": 7626, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b16b36b-b45d-4f57-a129-b32e04d3d1d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-3-programs.md", "file_name": "c4-3-programs.md", "file_size": 7626, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "b2ddae7b9ac22fd8a2243e9b66db071ef76c66c024c81d9d8b97cae618ce465a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cf43eaf-b78b-4481-95f4-f93fc47d4b4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-3-programs.md", "file_name": "c4-3-programs.md", "file_size": 7626, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "7eaafd1481806e95affa13a895f7f6fae01344853f4aa95d7de7fb0059adf345", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Orientation programs for large universities are often published on the university\u2019s website to inform students what is available to them.

These programs may be run by academic faculties or the international office and can include:\r\n\r\n  * Social activities run by senior students for newly arrived international students\r\n  * Activities to familiarise new students with their local area, and accommodation options\r\n  * Campus tours\r\n  * Learning support groups\r\n  * Emotional support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the [orientation program](http://www.uq.edu.au/orientation/) at the University of Queensland.\r\n\r\n### Returning home program\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that international students participate in a returning home program, especially if they are studying at university. These programs are an opportunity for students completing their studies to:\r\n\r\n  * Gather together and discuss their student experience\r\n  * Collect information about leaving Australia, settling accounts, accommodation, and arranging freight transfer for possessions\r\n  * Be acknowledged formally by the university on their achievements\r\n  * understand the experience of returning home and \u2018reverse culture-shock\u2019\r\n  * Say goodbye to classmates and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome universities hire academic caps and gowns so students can have official photographs taken. This is because many students leave Australia before their graduation ceremony or a ceremony is not held in their home country.\r\n\r\nPostgraduate students are connected through their university campuses to the Council of Postgraduate Associations ([CAPA](http://www.capa.edu.au/)), which was formed in 1979 to represent the rights and interests of postgraduate students. CAPA provides a national forum to discuss common issues for international postgraduates.\r\n\r\n### Spouse and partners programs\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-agung-pandit-wiguna-1128316-1024x746.jpg)\r\n\r\nMany universities have developed programs and activities for the partners of students, particularly postgraduates. Partners and children of students often need support and they are often isolated if they are not working or connected to their local communities. These programs aim to provide informal networks for these individuals.\r\n\r\nWhile pastoral care is part of the educational provider\u2019s obligations and student support is of a very high standard, students should realise that they are also responsible for finding out where support and information is available. It is expected that students will ask questions and seek information (and all services and support offices encourage this).\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C4.3 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-3-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c4-pastoral-care-issues/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c4-3-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3418, "end_char_idx": 7616, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1800058a-4bd6-4156-b27b-0b9cacbcec5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1800058a-4bd6-4156-b27b-0b9cacbcec5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness.md", "file_name": "c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness.md", "file_size": 4700, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20e992a2-acb7-4ca5-8427-649eca0a6810", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c4-pastoral-care-issues\\c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness.md", "file_name": "c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness.md", "file_size": 4700, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "4deaace2230b83bd7d6a2edbaaa1b75fad42f614aaa1232f4ed30cf9af87968b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f19d1e1-90bc-4e15-8c12-2a1cb6ddc9a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b19ebba9651c3988b1eea3558abeef6495ebdf75a85db7d04b4f276e1bffff07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c4-pastoral-care-issues\r\ntopic_slug: c4-4-cross-cultural-awareness\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C4.4 Cross-Cultural Awareness\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C4.

In order to gain the most from the experience, students should be encouraged to respect and learn about how other cultures and nationalities differ from their own.\r\n\r\nCultures may have different attitudes towards:\r\n\r\n  * Individual **rights** and collective rights \u2013 in Australia, generally the rights of the individual person are considered more important than the well-being of the community as a whole\r\n  * **Power** and inequality \u2013 most Australians are prepared to challenge the opinions of powerful people, eg teachers\r\n  * **Uncertainty** \u2013 Australian people are reasonably comfortable with uncertain situations and do not expect explicit rules of behaviour in all circumstances\r\n  * **Equality for females** \u2013 Australian people generally believe that females are the equals of males and should receive the same rights and rewards\r\n  * **Work and Play** \u2013 Australians put great value on their \u201clifestyle\u201d and their opportunities to enjoy sport, holidays etc. Other Asian cultures emphasise work as more important\r\n  * **Formality** \u2013 Australians are quite informal in their interactions with one another compared to many other cultures\r\n  * **Non verbal communication** \u2013 for example, how close people stand to one another in conversation or do they accept touching or handshakes with strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**An agent needs to be aware of their own cultural attitudes and their student\u2019s likely cross-cultural challenges when assisting their students to settle in Australia.** This includes understanding aspects of the teaching and learning environment in Australia that may be different and any behaviour and language that would seem unusual or unacceptable in the student\u2019s own country.\r\n\r\n### The Teaching and Learning Environment\r\n\r\n![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cx-insight-YloghyfD7e8-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn a classroom or lecture situation, Australian students are expected to demonstrate initiative and ask questions of the teacher or lecturer. This is not seen as disrespectful as it might in some other cultures but demonstrates to the teacher that the student is fully engaged in the lesson.\r\n\r\nAustralian educators put much less emphasis on memory recall than Asian countries, and typically students in Australia will be required to undertake group projects and independent research on how to solve problems as part of most courses. These skills may not commonly be required of students in their own cultures and they may be unfamiliar with how to approach such ideas.

In Australian education the term \u2018Pastoral Care\u2019 means the social, emotional and cultural support for students, and staff in schools, colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nFor international students, pastoral care sometimes has a broader meaning and includes services such as language and learning support, support programs, and specialised advice and information. This is because students coming to Australia to study require a higher level of care as:\r\n\r\n  * they are away from their family and friendship networks\r\n  * they are often not well-connected to community support systems\r\n  * they may need to study in a foreign language and\r\n  * they must function in an environment where values and behaviour patterns may be very different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Focus Questions\r\n\r\n  1. Which systems exist in Australian institutions to support international students?\r\n  2. How can an International Student Adviser help students?\r\n  3. How can an agent assist a student to prepare for their studies in Australia?\r\n  4.

However, you need to be careful when analysing data from different sources to ensure that like comparisons are made.\r\n\r\nFor example, data for Foundation Year students is not separated from Higher Education statistics and may also be reported within VET or Other Sector enrolments. Also, a Foundation Year student may have enrolled in an ELICOS course prior to commencing the Foundation Year program within the reporting period. This means that this student is counted as two enrolments \u2013 one in the ELICOS data and one in the Higher Education data.\r\n\r\n### Government sources of data\r\n\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT  \r\n---  \r\nAustrade  \r\n\u2013 [Student Enrolment Statistics](http://www.austrade.gov.au/Export/Export-Markets/Industries/Education/International-Student-Data/default.aspx)| \u2013 Austrade student enrolment data is derived from the PRISMS database and counts enrolments by students who require a student visa to enter Australia.  \r\n\u2013 Data includes commencements, finishes and year to date counts. It is broken down by nationality, sector, state/territory, field of study and level of study.  \r\n  \r\nNote that Austrade reports on enrolments as evidenced by eCoEs. For example, a student may have an eCoE for a Bachelor of Economics course and an eCoE for an ELICOS course at the same time \u2013 this counts as two enrolments.  \r\nAustrade offshore network  \r\n\u2013 [Offshore support](https://www.austrade.gov.au/)| \u2013 Located in many countries, Austrade offices provide training programs for local agents interested in increasing their knowledge about Australian institutions and market intelligence updates.  \r\nAustrade \u2013 Global Education News| \u2013 The Global Education News eNewsletter is delivered each fortnight and provides latest developments, market intelligence and opportunities from in-country sources for the education sector.

To compare agency recruitment performance against state and sector| \u2013 Did my agency record a decrease in enrolment numbers, despite an overall increase in international student enrolments for my country into a certain state and education sector?  \r\n2\\. To analyse core business against current statistics| \u2013 Is the demand for my services and representation a dying demand?  \r\n\u2013 Should I consider changing the mix of business?  \r\n  \r\nFor example, an agency specialising in ELICOS and primary and secondary education recruitment for Malaysian students may decide that the decreases experienced in these sectors in recent years indicate that opportunities for growth are limited and that there should be a realignment of the business to include other more popular sectors.  \r\n3\\. To identify market opportunities through horizontal growth| \u2013 Should I consider seeking additional institutional representation in other sectors and other states?  \r\n\u2013 Should I consider opening another branch office in another country to service the growing student demand for Australian education there?  \r\n4\\. To identify market opportunities through vertical growth| \u2013 Is there an opportunity to add value by providing further services for international students?  \r\n  \r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n  * guardianship services\r\n\r\n\r\n  * visa processing (employing an RMA)\r\n\r\n\r\n  * friends and family visiting tours\r\n\r\n\r\n  * academic staff study tours\r\n\r\n\r\n  * tourism services.\r\n\r\n  \r\n5\\. To analyse recruitment and marketing strategies| \u2013 If my agency recruits students mainly through advertisements in the local school newsletters and seminars at the local high schools, will this still be a reliable method for recruiting students if I change my business mix?  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C6.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c6-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Topic ](https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c6-1-sources-of-information/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c6-marketing-information/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c6-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2821, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f82f09a0-1772-464c-93e0-fe4a15b1b544": {"__data__": {"id_": "f82f09a0-1772-464c-93e0-fe4a15b1b544", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c6-marketing-information\\c6-marketing-information.md", "file_name": "c6-marketing-information.md", "file_size": 1839, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f48bf4c-c001-429b-ac4d-25f8c2b78984", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c6-marketing-information\\c6-marketing-information.md", "file_name": "c6-marketing-information.md", "file_size": 1839, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "2c4c8f3b9d2e3be4525f9dc53ba5005ec0a72e50ed9d8d346276c768ba3eaf11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c6-marketing-information/\r\ncontent_type: lesson\r\nlesson_slug: c6-marketing-information\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C6.

It is also a common practice to send a follow-up email after such conversations to summarise/clarify what was agreed by both parties.\r\n\r\nFiles should not be destroyed until it is certain that the student has no further business with the agent. This may not be until the student has completely finished their course of study or has formally appointed another agent in their place.\r\n\r\nNote that another individual may need to act on the material in a student\u2019s file at a later date. So, the material in the file should be complete and easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Back-up of records\r\n\r\nIt is important to back up student records on a regular basis. This can be done electronically for example, to guard against a major loss such as a fire or theft.\r\n\r\n### Privacy\r\n\r\nAgents should observe privacy principles when dealing with students\u2019 records. They should not disclose personal information to anyone who does not have a legitimate reason to access this information. Also, they should take reasonable steps to ensure the proper security of student information. \r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\nAgents can be asked to verify the authenticity of a document by an education provider, often by declaring that they have \u2018sighted\u2019 the original document.\r\n\r\nPhotocopies of documents are easily forged and care should be taken when accepting these.

Unfortunately, many providers exist solely to generate profit (this means they \u2018sell\u2019 qualifications for little academic work); they are usually called \u201cdiploma mills\u201d. At the same time there are sincere, but unaccredited institutions, whose quality of education is difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nThere are no set guidelines on how a qualification should be seen as \u2018acceptable\u2019. Australian institutions are free to determine the kinds of students for their courses. So, one qualification may be acceptable for one institution, but it may be unacceptable for another.\r\n\r\nThere is a range of resources available to make it easier to determine the acceptability of a qualification. It can be useful to use the [Generally Accepted Accrediting Principles (GAAP) Framework](http://www.b-ac.info/gaap-accreditation.html#:~:text=Generally%20accepted%20accrediting%20principles%20\\(GAAP\\)%20refer%20to%20a%20common%20set,centres%20and%20their%20education%20institutions.) to determine the acceptability of qualifications offered by an institution.\r\n\r\nIf an institution falls within the following guidelines, then probably an Australian education provider will accept this qualification:\r\n\r\n**Category**| **Requirement**  \r\n---|---  \r\nInstitutions in Australia| Listed on the Australian Qualifications Framework Register ([AQF](http://www.aqf.edu.au/RegisterAccreditation/AQFRegister/tabid/174/Default.aspx)).  \r\nInstitutions in the United States of America| Accredited by an agency recognised by either the [US Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) or the [Council for Higher Education Accreditation](http://www.chea.org/).  \r\nInstitutions in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth| Membership in the Association of Commonwealth Universities ([ACU](http://www.acu.ac.uk/)) and listed in the [Commonwealth Universities Yearbook](https://www.worldcat.org/title/3688319).  \r\nRest of the world| Accreditation and recognition through [AACRAO](https://www.aacrao.org/) and [NACES](https://www.naces.org/) with the participation of the College Board;  \r\nOR  \r\n-A listing in the Country Education Profiles, published by the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition and the Australian Education International ([NOOSR](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/services-and-resources/Pages/qualifications-recognition.aspx) \u2013 AEI).  \r\n  \r\nThe most commonly used guide of whether an institution accepts a qualification in Australia is the Country Education Profiles produced by [NOOSR \u2013 AEI.](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/services-and-resources/Pages/qualifications-recognition.aspx)\r\n\r\nAnother similar online system is maintained by [UK NARIC](http://www.naric.org.uk/).

Note that anybody can create an \u2018association\u2019 so it is important to check its credibility and status.\r\n\r\nMost authoritative professional bodies require qualifications to be undertaken at particular educational institutions, and prescribe the required coursework. Senior members of the professional association generally sit on the internal accreditation panels to ensure that courses meet its requirements. The range of organisations involved in professional education is large and covers:\r\n\r\n  * formal registration bodies\r\n  * external accreditation bodies\r\n  * voluntary professional associations\r\n  * trade unions with professional interests\r\n  * employer groups\r\n  * state and national peak bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin Australia, the following professions have professional bodies, which mandate a Bachelor Degree (or equivalent) as an educational qualification for membership and the right to practise in the field:\r\n\r\nAccountancy| Engineering| Nursing| Social Work  \r\n---|---|---|---  \r\nArchitecture| Law| Physiotherapy| Teaching  \r\nComputing| Medicine| Psychology| Veterinary Science  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ C7.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c7-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c7-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/c7-student-documents/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/c7-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3331, "end_char_idx": 5454, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3122068d-c998-4a4d-82ea-d9514c805bcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3122068d-c998-4a4d-82ea-d9514c805bcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c7-student-documents\\c7-3-qualification-authenticity.md", "file_name": "c7-3-qualification-authenticity.md", "file_size": 7411, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fb28913-0cea-496d-9611-cbfe325c7eea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\c7-student-documents\\c7-3-qualification-authenticity.md", "file_name": "c7-3-qualification-authenticity.md", "file_size": 7411, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "94f8c17b1626816c4b42776aec2349e808a42093095e1e24b16f3d91b1f5413f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "452c9cd0-4739-45e7-85a7-da380a7814e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83f5bcf97e6515ead079bc16065582fcc4d6cf2974a5855209ceb65c386bda80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/c7-3-qualification-authenticity/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: c7-student-documents\r\ntopic_slug: c7-3-qualification-authenticity\r\n---\r\n\r\n# C7.3 Qualification Authenticity\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [C7.

An agent should help institutions recognise any irregularities in students\u2019 applications as part of ensuring that the student is genuine in their wish to undertake studies in Australia.\r\n\r\nIn particular, **submitting forged or inauthentic documentation on behalf of a student is a serious matter and is likely to lead to an agent\u2019s contract being terminated by an institution unless it can be demonstrated that the agent was also deceived by the student.**\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to determine the main source countries of forged documents, where they are produced and how they are obtained. The Internet and other black market sources make them easily accessible across the globe.\r\n\r\nOne guide is to assess countries on their perceived level of risk with regard to corruption and risk of falsification. To do this you can use the Corruption Perceptions Index ([CPI](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/)) developed by Transparency International, which has developed a ranking of corruption. The CPI ranks a total of nearly 200 countries and provides a score between 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly law-abiding). See the following table for the CPI of the major student enrolments to Australia:\r\n\r\n**Ranking by source****of student numbers****for Australia**| **Country of source****of students****for Australia**| **Ranking of****country on CPI****(/180)**| **CPI****(/100)**  \r\n---|---|---|---  \r\n1| China| 66| 45  \r\n2| India| 85| 40  \r\n3| South Korea| 32| 62  \r\n4| Vietnam| 87| 39  \r\n5| Malaysia| 62| 48  \r\n6| Thailand| 110| 35  \r\n7| Indonesia| 96| 38  \r\n8| Nepal| 117| 33  \r\n9| Brazil| 96| 38  \r\n10| Saudi Arabia| 52| 53  \r\n _2021 Corruptions Index Data_\r\n\r\n### **Identifying Forged Documentation**\r\n\r\nYou may come across these 5 methods of forgery:\r\n\r\n**Method**| **Examples**  \r\n---|---  \r\n**Forged qualifications**  \r\n| These are created to represent a legitimate or fictitious institution, and/or program of study.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * They are either purchased from the Internet/another black market source or created by the holder themselves.\r\n  * The quality of the documents varies from perfect replicas through to very poor reproductions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n**Altered documents**|  These are official, legitimate documents that may have been altered through omissions, additions or changes.

The following example might help you:\r\n\r\n  * TAFE \u2013 [Application to become an agent](https://international.tafeqld.edu.au/agents/become-an-agent?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cross-cultural information\r\n\r\nThe following site provides summary information about different cultures and customs around the world:\r\n\r\n[Cultural Profiles in the Cultural Atlas](http://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/)\r\n\r\n### Global International Education Marketing Information\r\n\r\n**USA**\r\n\r\n  * [Open Doors](http://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors)\r\n  * Student and Exchange Visitor Program ([SEVP](http://www.ice.gov/sevis))\r\n  * Graduate Management Admission Council ([GMAC](http://www.gmac.com/gmac))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**United Kingdom**\r\n\r\n  * Higher Education Statistics Agency ([HESA](http://www.hesa.ac.uk/))\r\n  * Universities and Colleges Admission Service ([UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/))\r\n  * Independent Schools Council ([ISC](http://www.isc.co.uk/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**New Zealand**\r\n\r\n  * Education New Zealand ([ENZ](https://www.education.govt.nz/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Germany**\r\n\r\n  * German Academic Exchange Service ([DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**South Korea**\r\n\r\n  * Ministry of Education ([MOE](http://english.moe.go.kr/main.do?s=english))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Japan**\r\n\r\n  * Ministry of Culture, Education, Science, Sports and Technology ([MEXT](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying documents\r\n\r\nTo verify documents it may be possible to check with the graduations office of the conferring institution. However, sometimes this takes an extended period of time, or a response is never received.\r\n\r\nSome countries have developed centralised and online verification systems, which are useful tools to authenticate a qualification.

They need to trust the agent they use since many of them probably:\r\n\r\n  * have not travelled overseas before\r\n  * know little about Australia\r\n  * do not speak English well\r\n  * have limited information about the educational provider\r\n  * have only a general understanding of what living in Australia involves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large majority of agents that recruit students for educational institutions:\r\n\r\n  * are hard-working\r\n  * are fair in their dealings with students and the institutions they represent\r\n  * develop very good reputations among their clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some agents disadvantage their students by acting in an incompetent or dishonourable way. This has the potential to seriously damage the reputation of:\r\n\r\n  * themselves and their agencies\r\n  * the institutions they represent\r\n  * the Australian education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccessful student recruitment is often the result of word-of-mouth recommendations or repeat business. So, even if only a few agents act with poor standards or ethics, the news can spread quickly and often bad elements are exaggerated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the improper actions of a small number of agencies can lead to serious consequences. Students may:\r\n\r\n  * think the actions are more common than they actually are\r\n  * not trust other agencies even though they act correctly at all times\r\n  * choose to study in another country or decide not to study abroad at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Long-term success**\r\n\r\nObviously, different agencies are usually in competition with one another. Poor work practices may be profitable in the short-term for one particular agency, but they have the potential to eventually damage not only that agency but other reputable agencies as well.\r\n\r\nIn summary, an agent is responsible for developing a reputation for excellence to ensure sustainable long-term business. Maintaining high standards is essential for the continued viability of all agencies.\r\n\r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ D2.1 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/d2-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Lesson ](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d2-introduction/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d2-introduction/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/d2-1-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3061, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdc0d6f8-2af1-4bb4-a56d-c838b4d698b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdc0d6f8-2af1-4bb4-a56d-c838b4d698b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-2-professional-standards.md", "file_name": "d2-2-professional-standards.md", "file_size": 6438, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b383196-e298-4727-8e68-aca3b62df36e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-2-professional-standards.md", "file_name": "d2-2-professional-standards.md", "file_size": 6438, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "3f8dc24d77d84008e88e9ae1db50139c9ad1ef00ea2924043e65033c5ea429a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d7477ff-21b0-4202-b810-0cc39d38e3ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29eb4f672c7f5ac4b199da8dbd1b6ae1a03e4b4fb2b281a7bb55b23fd9fee820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d2-2-professional-standards/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: d2-introduction\r\ntopic_slug: d2-2-professional-standards\r\n---\r\n\r\n# D2.2 Professional Standards\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [D2.

This means they are committed to their clients, deliver high and consistent levels of service, and have ethical practices.\r\n\r\nSome important examples of proper standards are given below:\r\n\r\n### Dealing with students\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  \r\n---|---  \r\nProviding sufficient and accurate information to students| Students need to able to make an appropriate choice of course and/or institution.  \r\nKeeping adequate records| It is essential that agents keep clear and organised records regarding:\r\n\r\n  * information provided to students\r\n  * biographical data\r\n  * copies of documents they have submitted as part of applications\r\n  * copies of correspondence with institutions about a particular application\r\n  * relevant student visa documentation.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaintaining contact after a course has begun| Agents should continue to maintain contact and help students with relevant issues as they arise.  \r\nHaving clear cost structures| Students should be made aware of:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * relevant the costs involved in using an agent\r\n  * when and how this money should be paid\r\n  * what is not included within an agent\u2019s services.\r\n\r\n  \r\nResponding to questions in a timely manner| Agents should answer questions from their students within a reasonable time period.  \r\n  \r\n### Dealing with institutions\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  \r\n---|---  \r\nSubmitting applications to institutions only from students who have a genuine intention to study| \r\n\r\n  * Sending applications to a range of institutions for an individual student can be what a student requests in order to find out the range of options they have. However, agents need to be aware that submitting an application to an institution that the student has no realistic chance or intention of attending creates unnecessary administrative work for both the institution and the agent.\r\n  * Institutions expect their agents to filter applications and do not appreciate the considerable work generated to assess an individual for entry unnecessarily. In practice, many agencies limit students to applying to no more than 3 institutions at a time.\r\n  * At times, students may seek to use multiple agencies to apply to as many institutions as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\nCommunicating appropriately with organisations| Agents should identify the appropriate individuals to contact in regard to:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * student inquiries\r\n  * applications\r\n  * enrolments\r\n  * recruitment\r\n  * problems that arise.\r\n\r\nAgents should consider whether email or other forms of communication are the most appropriate form for any particular situation. An email can provide a clear record of what is being communicated and it\u2019s a very popular form of communication. But, in some circumstances it may be necessary to discuss an issue by telephone and then follow up with an email to confirm what has been understood.  \r\nRepresenting the institution and its courses accurately| Agents should have a clear understanding of the institutions they represent. This includes:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * having a reasonably detailed understanding of the local environment and facilities available to students\r\n  * understanding what a particular course of study involves\r\n  * knowing what employment can be expected following the successful completion of a course.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdvertising with approval| Agents should ensure that an institution has explicitly agreed to any advertising. This includes using the crest or symbol of an organisation to market an exhibition or publication.  \r\n  \r\nAt times, agents believe that having an agent agreement with an institution provides them with the right to use their materials and symbols at any time. However, institutions should always be informed of when their name and reputation is being used.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Dealing with other agents**\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  \r\n---|---  \r\nNot discounting fees without an institution being aware| Some agents offer discounts on students\u2019 tuition fees by paying a portion of the institution\u2019s tuition fees themselves. In this manner they seek to encourage more students to their agency. The institution is normally unaware that this is occurring.   \r\n  \r\nWhile as a business strategy this is not necessarily wrong or illegal, often agents who are not planning a long-term business strategy undertake this practice.

The institution is normally unaware that this is occurring.   \r\n  \r\nWhile as a business strategy this is not necessarily wrong or illegal, often agents who are not planning a long-term business strategy undertake this practice. They can be individuals without office premises (and the costs that go with this) who work alone. They calculate that if they can recruit enough students in this manner, the commission they receive from the institution will cover the sum that they have discounted. Unfortunately, they commonly provide very little (if any) service once a student has been placed and are focused only on the recruitment of more individuals not on providing quality service.  \r\n  \r\nOther, more established, long-term agencies lose business to these types of agents because they have larger business overheads and provide a comprehensive service. In the end, many of the students recruited by such short-term agents end up dealing with the more established agents when they need help once their studies have begun.  \r\n  \r\nIt is important for agents to realise that business practices that drive other agents out of business with unsustainable discounts are ultimately bad for all. They lower the reputation of agents as a whole and focus the agent community on recruitment alone rather than quality service.  \r\n  \r\nSelf-Test: Check Your Knowledge\r\n\r\n[ D2.2 Check Your Knowledge ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/d2-2-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[ Previous Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/d2-1-check-your-knowledge/)\r\n\r\n[Back to Lesson](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d2-introduction/)\r\n\r\n[ Next Quiz ](https://www.icef.com/academy/quizzes/d2-2-check-your-knowledge/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4036, "end_char_idx": 6424, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be8b92fb-c141-4413-951e-846d133ceabf": {"__data__": {"id_": "be8b92fb-c141-4413-951e-846d133ceabf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-3-ethics.md", "file_name": "d2-3-ethics.md", "file_size": 9432, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca405101-440b-48b0-bd6d-578a652e912f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-3-ethics.md", "file_name": "d2-3-ethics.md", "file_size": 9432, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "216cec67e8b96fe5df0ec38771a4bd19d5d5772fbe3b9971b6dde40e811ba118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ffb0daa4-d897-4569-b095-045cfa7e2a9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe40c6d696fb18b37b925de40e2810c10e47156c48033520536f250d99dc4e60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "---\r\nsource_url: https://www.icef.com/academy/topic/d2-3-ethics/\r\ncontent_type: topic\r\nlesson_slug: d2-introduction\r\ntopic_slug: d2-3-ethics\r\n---\r\n\r\n# D2.3 Ethics\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [D2.

It is based on the London Statement, a 2012 landmark statement by the UK, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand on a best practice approach to ethical recruitment by education agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Ethics can be found [here](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/News/Latest-News/Documents/Australian%20International%20Education%20and%20Training%20-%20Agent%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf). The Ethical framework includes guidance on the following:\r\n\r\n  * **Integrity** \u2013 being straightforward and honest in all professional and business dealings\r\n  * **Objectivity** \u2013 not allowing professional judgment to be compromised by bias or conflict of interest\r\n  * **Professional competence and due care** \u2013 maintaining professional knowledge and professional service, and acting diligently\r\n  * **Transparency** \u2013 declaring conflicts of interest to all clients, especially when service fees are charged to both the education provider and the prospective student\r\n  * **Confidentiality** \u2013 respecting and preserving the confidentiality of personal information acquired and not releasing such information to third parties without proper authority\r\n  * **Professional behaviour** \u2013 acting in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and dealing with clients competently, diligently and fairly and\r\n  * **Professionalism and purpose** \u2013 acting in a manner that will serve the interests of clients and the wider society even at the expense of self-interest; recognising that dedication to these principles is the means by which the profession can earn the trust and confidence of stakeholder groups (individual clients, the public, business and government).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seven principles of the Code of Ethics are below.\r\n\r\n  1. Agents and consultants practice responsible business ethics.\r\n  2. Agents and consultants provide current, accurate and honest information in an ethical manner.\r\n  3. Agents and consultants develop transparent business relationships with students and providers through the use of written agreements.\r\n  4. Agents and consultants protect the interests of minors.\r\n  5. Agents and consultants provide current and up-to-date information that enables international students to make informed choices when selecting which agent or consultant to employ.\r\n  6. Agents and consultants act professionally.\r\n  7. Agents and consultants work with destination countries and providers to raise ethical standards and best practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ethical agent demonstrates this understanding in their work.\r\n\r\n### Unethical Practice in Dealings with Students\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanation**  \r\n---|---  \r\nCharging \u2018hidden\u2019 fees| Some agents have charged students fees for their services progressively without informing them from the beginning. For example, once a student\u2019s application has been sent to providers, they begin to introduce new charges for student visa applications, or medical checks. This is unethical behaviour.  \r\nMisrepresenting fee structures| A number of agents have misrepresented the fee structure of some providers\u2019 courses. For example, a student normally pays OHSC on enrolment. There have been reports of agents not informing student\u2019s that OHSC has been included in the fee and keeping this portion of money. Just before the student applies for their student visa, they learn from their agent that their OHSC has not been paid and are asked to pay this money again.  \r\nPlacement into a course for commission reasons alone without due regard of a students needs| An agency may have a limited number of providers that it recruits for and can claim commission. So, there is a temptation to persuade students to go to one of these providers against the educational interests of the student.  \r\nNot protecting students personal details| In the normal course of their role, agents learn a great deal of personal information about their students.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4849, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffb0daa4-d897-4569-b095-045cfa7e2a9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffb0daa4-d897-4569-b095-045cfa7e2a9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-3-ethics.md", "file_name": "d2-3-ethics.md", "file_size": 9432, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca405101-440b-48b0-bd6d-578a652e912f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-3-ethics.md", "file_name": "d2-3-ethics.md", "file_size": 9432, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "216cec67e8b96fe5df0ec38771a4bd19d5d5772fbe3b9971b6dde40e811ba118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be8b92fb-c141-4413-951e-846d133ceabf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\shahi\\Desktop\\AU-Education-Agent-Search\\mark_down_content\\d2-introduction\\d2-3-ethics.md", "file_name": "d2-3-ethics.md", "file_size": 9432, "creation_date": "2025-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-02"}, "hash": "504e76adf8bacefea72a422d79517c06f9a7b9dcb28ecd39b3488a41d50bb45d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "edd35f33-9728-4d32-ae0e-eb40eb487fe7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7c6fc058c969074fc37d787ddbda54b242ae09574212017c99d0276baeb11c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This is unethical behaviour.  \r\nMisrepresenting fee structures| A number of agents have misrepresented the fee structure of some providers\u2019 courses.

So, there is a temptation to persuade students to go to one of these providers against the educational interests of the student.  \r\nNot protecting students personal details| In the normal course of their role, agents learn a great deal of personal information about their students. It is important that they:\r\n\r\n  * treat this information confidentially and carefully\r\n  * do not pass this on to other businesses or people without the permission of the student.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Unethical Practice in Dealings with providers\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanation**  \r\n---|---  \r\nSubmitting fraudulent documents| In some cases agents have knowingly submitted false documents to providers and sometimes they have been involved in creating the false documentation.  \r\n  \r\nWhile many academic documents can be verified (such as language test results), other documents can be more difficult to identify such as work-related testimonials.  \r\nDeceptive advertising| It is important that advertising does not mislead students, even though it will seek to inform students of the benefits of studying at a particular provider or course.  \r\n  \r\nA course outcome can be misleading if false claims are made about:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  * likely employment on successful completion\r\n  * a provider\u2019s facilities\r\n  * the local environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUnfair comparisons| Similar to deceptive advertising, false comparisons can be drawn between courses or providers to make a course or provider appear more or less appealing. For example, the name of a provider may be similar to a prestigious university and suggestions that the two are linked may unfairly promote the first provider.  \r\nHidden sub-agent networks| Many agents form business relationships with other agencies, especially to form co-operative arrangements that allow them to cover a larger geographical area or represent more institutions. However, the ESOS Act makes providers responsible for their agent\u2019s activities and the provider should always approve where their marketing material is circulated and who is counselling students on their behalf. Sub-agencies are not a problem if providers are fully informed of the arrangements.  \r\n  \r\nSome sub-agent networks are hidden from providers, which believe that one agent alone is recruiting from a particular region when in fact a number of agencies are recruiting on their behalf but only one agent submits the documents. This practice puts the providers at risk under Australian law.  \r\n  \r\n### Unethical Practice in Dealings with the education industry\r\n\r\n**Examples:**| **Explanation**  \r\n---|---  \r\nObtaining student visas for individuals who do not intend to study| Agents need to ensure that individuals come to Australia for the purpose of study.  \r\nNot adhering to the legislation surrounding visa advice| For agencies in Australia, the laws governing visa advice require individuals to be Registered Migration Agents to provide substantive visa advice. There is a fine line between providing general study advice and student visa information, so agencies may be tempted to provide this information unlawfully.  \r\n  \r\nThis does not apply to agencies operating outside of Australia.  \r\nBeing engaged in fraudulent practices| Some agents have arranged for other students to sit for the English language tests on behalf of a student who is weak in English.  \r\n  \r\nSome agents have acted dishonestly by preparing inauthentic documents for their student clients.  \r\n\u2018Poaching\u2019 students from other agents and institutions| It is natural that sometimes students wish to change from using one agent to another. For example, they may not want to apply to an institution that the first agent does not represent. However, some agencies engage in systematic \u2018poaching\u2019. This means that once a student has gained a substantial amount of information from one agent, another agent approaches them and offers some form of inducement (eg. a fee discount) so the student changes to apply through the second agent. The original agent gets no commission for their initial work. Similarly, some agents induce students to change institutions in the same way without regard for educational suitability or outcomes.  \r\n  \r\nThese practices are harmful as they set agencies and institutions against one another and promote the idea that recruitment alone is the only important aspect of an agent\u2019s role.

Extension: Emerging Bad Practice\r\n\r\n[Education Agent Training Course (EATC)](https://www.icef.com/academy/courses/education-agent-training-course-eatc/) [D4. Extension: Emerging Bad Practice](https://www.icef.com/academy/lessons/d4-extension-emerging-bad-practice/)\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nWhile only a small proportion of the agent community, a few individuals in our industry seek to gain advantage by unethical means and they will seek ways to avoid scrutiny. The following examples of problematic practices are emerging and are damaging to the reputation of everybody working in recruiting students for Australia.\r\n\r\n**Emerging Issues with SVP**\r\n\r\nThe Streamlined Visa Processing (SVP) regime has enabled certain students and their agents to gain student visas as part of a SVP package of study but without any intention of studying at the nominated institution. Once arriving in Australia, some students are withdrawing immediately from the institution they had enrolled in and are transferring to other \u2018cheaper\u2019 institutions often in different sectors. This is resulting in the original recruiting institution spending considerable administrative time for no benefit and the original institution ultimately bearing responsibility for these students under the SVP rules. It also supports a culture of \u201ccourse hopping\u201d.\r\n\r\nSome Agents are facilitating this by:\r\n\r\n  * Producing **fraudulent documents** to meet entry requirements or to support requests of withdrawal from studies and transfer to other providers. There have been cases of letters of offer altered by agents, particularly with changes to the amount of fees charged.\r\n  * Cases of **fake flight tickets** to support withdrawal requests were discovered by a number of providers. There was an instance where a significant number of tickets had the same reference number and were paid with the same credit card.\r\n  * **Early visa approvals** , often two months before formal commencement of courses, are creating the issue of non-genuine students having the opportunity to find alternative programs and withdraw from their original provider, before starting their studies.\r\n  * Some regional providers identified the issues of **students being misled** by agents in regards to the provider\u2019s **location**. An example was provided where students enrolled in an institution located in the Sunshine Coast but had to commute every day from Brisbane (over 1 hour). \r\n  * A **network of people** , including education and migration agents and representatives from poor quality education and training institutions, appear to be active in providing information to international students on arrival \u2013 particularly in regards to course hopping and other **poor practices**. Letters requesting withdrawals are usually written very clearly and professionally, with references to relevant ESOS legislation showing a command of English above that of the student themselves. A number of letters have been identified as identical, suggesting the systematic support of non-genuine students in some cases. These students requesting transfers between providers are usually not interested in counselling or intervention strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Note: This extension section is provided for information
