[PRISMS](https://prisms.deewr.gov.au/) is a secure web site and requires a login identifier and password. This differs from CRICOS, which is a publicly accessible database.

PRISMS is used by education providers more than agents. However, a provider may give its agent(s) the authority to create CoEs.

The Principal Executive Officer (PEO) or an authorised delegate of the provider can allow an agent to access PRISMS for that provider’s courses. The agent can then create a CoE or advise on course information. The PEO is also listed on CRICOS for each provider.

If the agent creates a CoE, then

  1. (s)he can enter relevant information into the CoE form;
  2. a member of the provider’s staff will then authorise the CoE.



Education providers use PRISMS to communicate information about their international students to the Department of Home Affairs. This is done for the purpose of obtaining and maintaining a valid student visa.
