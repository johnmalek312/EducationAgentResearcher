### Overview

**PRISMS** is the [**Provider Registration and International Student Management System**](https://prisms.education.gov.au/) which is a web-based database.

PRISMS produces and tracks all Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) documents that are produced for international students studying in Australia on a student visa. These CoEs are necessary for the issuing of student visas.

CRICOS is also contained within the PRISMS database. CRICOS records all of the registered courses for each provider that is registered to provide education to an overseas student studying in Australia on a student visa.

Students on another type of visa other than a Student visa do not require a CoE therefore they do not require a recording in PRISMS.

### Focus Questions

  1. Can an agent access PRISMS?
  2. What information does PRISMS contain?
