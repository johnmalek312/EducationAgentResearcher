### Overview

Agents can play an important role in looking after the welfare of students while they are in Australia. In Australian education the term ‘Pastoral Care’ means the social, emotional and cultural support for students, and staff in schools, colleges and universities.

For international students, pastoral care sometimes has a broader meaning and includes services such as language and learning support, support programs, and specialised advice and information. This is because students coming to Australia to study require a higher level of care as:

  * they are away from their family and friendship networks
  * they are often not well-connected to community support systems
  * they may need to study in a foreign language and
  * they must function in an environment where values and behaviour patterns may be very different.



### Focus Questions

  1. Which systems exist in Australian institutions to support international students?
  2. How can an International Student Adviser help students?
  3. How can an agent assist a student to prepare for their studies in Australia?
  4. Why is it important for students to attend an institution’s orientation week?
