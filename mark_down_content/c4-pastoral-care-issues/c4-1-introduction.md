Pastoral care broadly concerns:

  * Systems
  * Facilities and services and
  * Accommodation.



### Systems

All education providers have systems of pastoral care for students. How they organise these depends on the size of the provider and the educational sector.

Resources might include:

  * specialised staff
  * a student support office
  * a communication system to let students and staff know where help may be found and
  * physical facilities such as student drop-in centres, lounges and information boards placed in locations where students gather.



### Facilities and services

Pastoral care facilities are varied in the way they are managed and who manages them. Universities, colleges and schools have student support staff who are located in student support units, and within faculties and departments.

A University Student Union, Guild or Student Association provides facilities for specific groups of students, including legal advice, health services and student clubs and organisations, which offer support and networking opportunities for new and continuing students. Often the student organisations have their own office and provide informal advice for students.

It is common for universities, colleges and schools to provide prayer rooms and specially allocated places for religious observance, in recognition that international students are from many faiths.

An indirect way pastoral care is managed by education providers is the encouragement of ‘campus life’, which covers the whole experience students have when they come to university or school. Campus life includes activities, sports, meetings, festivals, events and networks. Students should be advised that being involved in campus life is an excellent way to be responsible for their own pastoral care.

### Accommodation

Pastoral care services are often located with residential facilities, so that students can access help after hours. Many residential colleges have a person employed to assist students.

When living in rental accommodation students should be encouraged to locate the nearest services such as doctors when they settle in. Many, but not all homestay carers will assist students to find the best pastoral care at school or in the community.
