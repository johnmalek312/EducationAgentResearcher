Temperature – Rainfall – Biodiversity – Natural Wonders

### Temperature

Australia has a relatively warm climate. However, extreme temperatures have been recorded such as:

  * 53°C at Cloncurry (Queensland) in 1889,
  * -23°C at Charlotte Pass (NSW) in 1994.



Australia’s climatic zones are shown below from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/climate-classifications/index.jsp):

![climate_zones](https://www.icef.com/academy//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3265_SecA_1_3_climate_zones_original.jpeg)

  
This map indicates that summers tend to be hotter and more humid in the north and winters are usually colder in the south. These temperature differences are revealed in the average temperatures for Australia’s capital cities in this table (from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/500140D8B530B914CA2573D200106B29?opendocument)):

| JANUARY| JULY  
---|---|---  
AUSTRALIAN CITY| Max (°C)| Min (°C)| Max (°C)| Min (°C)  
Adelaide (SA)| 28.7| 16.8| 15.2| 7.4  
Brisbane (Qld)| 29.2| 21.2| 20.6| 9.5  
Canberra (ACT)| 27.7| 13.3| 11.5| -0.1  
Darwin (NT)| 31.8| 24.8| 30.7| 19.4  
Hobart (Tas)| 21.8| 12.5| 12.2| 4.7  
Melbourne (Vic)| 25.8| 15.4| 13.9| 6.8  
Perth (WA)| 31.9| 17.2| 17.9| 8.4  
Sydney (NSW)| 26.1| 19.4| 17.2| 8.6  
  
Overall Australian cities tend to have mild climates in comparison to other cities in English-speaking countries. The following average temperatures have been compiled from the [World Meteorological Organization](http://www.worldweather.org/):

| SUMMER| WINTER  
---|---|---  
WORLD CITY| Max (°C)| Min (°C)| Max (°C)| Min (°C)  
Sydney (Australia)| 26.1| 19.4| 17.2| 8.6  
London (England)| 22.3| 13.7| 7.2| 2.4  
New York (USA)| 28.2| 20.1| 3.1| -3.9  
Auckland (New Zealand)| 23.6| 15.9| 14.0| 6.9  
Toronto (Canada)| 26.4| 17.9| -1.1| -7.1  
  
  
### Rainfall

Australia has a low average annual rainfall but high falls occur in the north. The rainfall zones are shown below from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/zones.htm):

![seasonal_zones_rainfall](https://www.icef.com/academy//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3266_seasonal_zones_rainfall_web_original.png)

This map shows that northern and eastern regions have wet summers and that central Australia is very dry. This is revealed in the data of the rainfall in Australian cities as listed below (from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/500140D8B530B914CA2573D200106B29?opendocument)). It is clear that Darwin in the tropical north has the highest summer rainfall and highest annual rainfall.

### Biodiversity

Australia has a wide variety of unique distinctive flora and fauna. The major reason for this is related to its geological history. Initially, Australia was part of a larger continent but about 40 million years ago it separated fully and became an isolated continent.

After this separation, marsupial mammals best adapted to the Australian environment and eventually dominated it. Australia is one of the few places on Earth to have such a large number of marsupials, and to have the only two monotreme mammals. These two types of [fauna](http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/fauna/index.htm) can be explained as follows:

  * Marsupial mammals give birth to their young and carry them in a pouch.  
Examples – Kangaroo, Koala, Wombat.
  * Monotreme mammals lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.  
Examples – Platypus, Echidna.

Despite its long history, Australia’s biodiversity has changed dramatically in the last 200 years. Since European settlement, many ecosystems have been radically simplified and fragmented. Also, many plants and animals have been introduced from around the world, and they have had serious environmental consequences. An example of this is the [cane toad](http://australianmuseum.net.au/Cane-Toad).  


### Natural Wonders

Australia is an island continent and its landscape consists mainly of low plateaus, which are sectioned off by several rugged mountain ranges. The [Great Dividing Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range) is the longest mountain range that starts in central Victoria and ends in Northern Queensland and is several thousand kilometres in length.

The landscape in the tropical north consists of rainforest that leads into large areas of grasslands. These eventually merge into the central deserts, which are the largest in the world outside of the Sahara. This part of Australia is called the Red Centre, because of the unusual red colour of its sand.

Three unique natural wonders are described here:

#### 1\. Great Barrier Reef

The [Great Barrier Reef](http://www.greatbarrierreef.org/) stretches over 2000 kilometres and covers an area of almost 35 million hectares on the north-east continental shelf of Australia. It runs from north of [Fraser Island](http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/fraser/index.html) to the tip of [Cape York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York_Peninsula) and provides habitats for many forms of marine life.

The Reef is a scuba divers paradise with 2,900 individual reefs, 71 coral islands, 350 different species of coral, and over 1,500 species of fish. Also, it provides a major breeding ground for humpback whales and a feeding ground for endangered species such as dugongs and turtles.

#### 2\. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park

![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/photoholgic-1GFUOji-yck-unsplash-1024x708.jpg)_Ayers Rock, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park_

[Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park](http://www.parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/) covers 132,566 hectares close to the centre of Australia and is owned by the Anangu Aboriginal people. It contains a range of remarkable geological and landform features including the spectacular monoliths of Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas).

The park is co-managed by Parks Australia and the Anangu people. Uluru has been the focus of religious, cultural, territorial and economic inter-relations among the Aboriginal peoples of the Western Desert for thousands of years. It is 340 metres high and has a circumference of 9.4 kilometres.

Kata Tjuta means ‘many heads’ and rock formations consist of 36 steep-sided domes. Mount Olga is its highest peak at 500 metres high.

#### 3\. Tasmanian Wilderness

The island state of Tasmania is separated from mainland Australia. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area is one of the largest conservation reserves in Australia. It covers about 20 per cent of Tasmania (1.38 million hectares), and it is one of only three temperate wilderness areas remaining in the Southern Hemisphere.

This area contains rocks of every geological period and is a major centre for plant diversity. Its Huon pines, which can be up to 2000 years old, are some of the oldest trees in the world. Also, several animals that are now extinct on mainland Australia still survive there.
