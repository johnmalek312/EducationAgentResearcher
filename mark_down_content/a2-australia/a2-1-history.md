You’ll briefly look at four periods of Australian history:

Pre-1700s – 1700s – 1800s – 1900s

### Pre-Colonisation

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people possess the most ancient living culture on Earth, having inhabited the land for an estimated 80,000 years before it was colonised. Estimates of how many Indigenous people lived in Australia at the time of European settlement vary from 300,000 to 1 million. However, there were at least 250 distinct language groups before colonisation, with approximately 700 dialects spoken across 500 different clan groups or ‘nations’.

Traditional Aboriginal culture and social organisation depended on a complex system of rules and kinship networks. This is informed by a sophisticated system of beliefs, called the Dreaming, which define the roles and responsibilities of people and their relationships between each other and the land. Such cultural practices are expressed, preserved and passed on through a rich oral tradition.

There remains an extensive mix of traditions, spiritualities and customs among today’s Indigenous population. Traditional beliefs and practices vary significantly across different regions and groups. 

However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people generally share a common holistic worldview that emphasises the reciprocal relationship and interconnectedness between people, landforms, animals and other elements of natural landscapes. This philosophy is based on spirituality, ecology and consensual-communal organisation, and involves a custodial relationship to the land that many believe confirms their Indigenous identity.  


### 1600s/1700s

The European exploration of Australia started in the 1600s, when Dutch explorers visited the northern and western coasts of Australia and discovered Tasmania. The first British explorer to the area was William Dampier, who landed on the northwest coast in 1688.

In 1770, James Cook landed on the eastern coast of Australia, naming it ‘New South Wales’ and claiming the territory for Great Britain.

European settlement of Australia began in 1788, when Britain established a penal colony on the east coast. British colonisation aimed to use Australia as a base for trade with South East Asia and China, and also relieve the overcrowded prisons in Britain.

Captain Arthur Phillip commanded eleven ships full of convicts, military guards and officials, arriving in Australia on January 18, 1788 at Botany Bay. After 8 days, this group of 1,373 people, (including 732 convicts) moved a few kilometres north to Port Jackson. Their settlement here later grew into the city of Sydney.

Australia Day (26th of January) is an annual public holiday that commemorates the start of settlement at Port Jackson.

However, colonisation had devastating impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The original population was reduced by approximately 90% as they were exposed to foreign diseases or killed; many were dispossessed from their traditional lands and separated from their cultural identities.  


### 1800s

The colonisation of Australia grew rapidly and expanded across the entire continent. Within the next hundred years, additional colonies were established near present day Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, and Melbourne. Colonists faced difficult conditions in settling in the new environment. A national character of toughness, independence and perseverance emerged.

Great Britain sent over a further 160,000 convicts to Australia over the following 80 years. The rise of the wool industry and discovery of gold in the mid-1800s also saw many British and Irish settlers arrive voluntarily. Around 40,000 Chinese immigrants came to Australia in search of gold between 1852 and 1889.

Australia’s distance from Europe made British governance over the colonies difficult. The colonists also wanted self-governance, so in 1850 the British Government gave the colonies the power to make their own laws.

By the end of the 19th century, Australia consisted of six self-governing colonies: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Each colony was a distinct political entity with its own parliament, governor, laws and regulations.  


### 1900s

It was eventually agreed that the colonies needed to join together to protect and promote their common interests. A national government was created on January 1, 1901, an event is known as ‘Federation’. This produced a united country and resulted in important feelings of pride and patriotism in the Australian public. (You’ll learn more about the Federal Government in 1.5.)

Australia faced a national challenge when it entered World War I. Soldiers from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (called the ANZACs) landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey on April 25, 1915. They fought an unsuccessful battle that lasted for 8 months and resulted in 26,111 Australian casualties. However, the fighting and personal qualities of the ANZACs contributed to the national identity and helped to unite the Australian people. Today, ANZAC Day is a national holiday on the 25th of April that commemorates the contributions and sacrifices of all men and women from the armed services.

Almost a million Australians served in World War II. The Australian mainland came under direct attack for the first time as Japanese aircrafts bombed Darwin and Japanese submarines attacked Sydney Harbour. Australia’s vulnerability to an invasion influenced a decision to increase its population and encourage the migration of people from about 200 countries.

In total, about 7 million people have migrated to Australia since the end of WWII (including displaced people). Their arrival has influenced all aspects of Australian society.

Today, more than one in four Australians were born overseas. New Zealand and United Kingdom have been the largest source countries for migrants. More recently, immigration from Asian countries such as China and India have become more significant.
