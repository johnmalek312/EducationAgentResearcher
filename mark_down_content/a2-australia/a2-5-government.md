Australia is a liberal parliamentary democracy, similar to the USA and UK. It is based on:

  * freedom of speech and association,
  * religious tolerance.



Australia’s written constitution outlines all government activities. For example, the federal government is responsible for foreign relations and trade, defence and immigration. Other aspects of governance are shared between the States and the Federal Government. In particular, Federal and State governments cooperate in administering the laws that govern education.

The Australian government is based on a popularly elected Parliament with two chambers, the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). The party that holds the majority of seats in the House of Representatives forms the government. However, minority parties often hold the balance of power in the Senate, which serves to review the decisions of the government.

Government Ministers are appointed from the Lower House and Upper House to conduct executive government. Policy decisions are made in Cabinet meetings.

Voting in Australia is compulsory and about 90% of voters participate in federal elections. Elections usually occur every 2.5 to 3 years.

The Federal Government’s leader is called the Prime Minister. Currently, the main political parties and people involved in the federal government are summarised here:

GOVERNMENT| OPPOSITION  
---|---  
[Prime Minister](http://www.pm.gov.au/)  
The Hon. Anthony Albanese

Mr Peter Dutton  
a member of the [Liberal Party of Australia](https://www.liberal.org.au/)  
Deputy Prime Minister  
– The Hon. Richard Marles  
– a member of the [Australian Labor Party](http://www.alp.org.au/)| Deputy Leader of the Opposition  
Ms Sussan Ley  
a member of the [Liberal Party of Australia](https://www.liberal.org.au/)  
  
Members of other smaller political parties have seats in the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament.

Although Australia is an independent nation, King Charles III of Britain is formally King of Australia and is the constitutional monarch. The King accepts the advice of the elected Australian Government to appoint a Governor-General, who represents him. The Governor-General has wide powers but by convention acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister. In the States, the King is represented by State Governors.  


### State

Each State and Territory has its own democratically elected government and leader:

  * the State Government leader is called the Premier,
  * the Territory leader is called the Chief Minister.



State parliaments are subject to the national Constitution as well as their State constitutions. In practice, the federal and state governments cooperate in many areas such as education, transport, health, and law enforcement.

### Local

Local government councils control the urban and rural areas, taking care of issues such as local transport, rubbish collection and town planning. Local councils are active in providing services such as libraries, childcare services as well as activities and events. Local councils also promote their regions as study and tourist destinations, so they sometimes have interaction with education agents. The leader of a council is called the Mayor.
