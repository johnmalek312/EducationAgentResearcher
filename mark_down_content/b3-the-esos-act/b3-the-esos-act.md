### Overview

The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (the ESOS Act) is the legislation that covers the provision of education and training to overseas students who come to Australia to study on a student visa.

Under the ESOS Act, providers registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) are responsible for the actions of their agents in relation to:

  * Providing marketing and student information; and
  * Recruiting and placing of students; and
  * act honestly and in good faith, and in the best interests of the student



So, you need a good understanding of the ESOS Act and the related National Code 2018. This also means you should take clear instruction from the institutions you represent regarding the activities you undertake on their behalf.

### Focus Questions

  1. According to the ESOS Act, how is an agent expected to behave?
  2. How should an Agent not behave?
  3. How are students protected if an institution closes?
