Students and their parents or guardians spend a lot of time and money to make the best educational choices that they can. They need to trust the agent they use since many of them probably:

  * have not travelled overseas before
  * know little about Australia
  * do not speak English well
  * have limited information about the educational provider
  * have only a general understanding of what living in Australia involves.



The large majority of agents that recruit students for educational institutions:

  * are hard-working
  * are fair in their dealings with students and the institutions they represent
  * develop very good reputations among their clients.



Unfortunately, some agents disadvantage their students by acting in an incompetent or dishonourable way. This has the potential to seriously damage the reputation of:

  * themselves and their agencies
  * the institutions they represent
  * the Australian education system.



Successful student recruitment is often the result of word-of-mouth recommendations or repeat business. So, even if only a few agents act with poor standards or ethics, the news can spread quickly and often bad elements are exaggerated.

Therefore, the improper actions of a small number of agencies can lead to serious consequences. Students may:

  * think the actions are more common than they actually are
  * not trust other agencies even though they act correctly at all times
  * choose to study in another country or decide not to study abroad at all.



**Long-term success**

Obviously, different agencies are usually in competition with one another. Poor work practices may be profitable in the short-term for one particular agency, but they have the potential to eventually damage not only that agency but other reputable agencies as well.

In summary, an agent is responsible for developing a reputation for excellence to ensure sustainable long-term business. Maintaining high standards is essential for the continued viability of all agencies.
