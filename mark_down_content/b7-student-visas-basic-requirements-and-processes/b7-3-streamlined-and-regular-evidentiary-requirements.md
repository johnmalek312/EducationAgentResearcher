#### Streamlined Evidentiary Requirements

Under the SSVF, students associated with the lowest evidentiary rating will have streamlined evidentiary requirements and generally these students will be able to satisfy the Department of their financial capacity by providing a declaration with their visa application and their English proficiency by a Confirmation of Enrolment from their education provider.

The Genuine Temporary Entry (GTE) requirement remains the key measure that determines if a student is eligible for the grant of the visa. However, as of March 23, 2024, the GTE requirement has been replaced by a new Genuine Student (GS) requirement for student visa applications. This change was part of a broader effort to streamline the application process and enhance immigration integrity. The GS requirement involves answering targeted questions rather than submitting a lengthy statement. This aims to provide visa decision-makers with clearer insights into applicants’ intentions and circumstances. Applications submitted before this date will still be assessed under the GTE requirement.

While evidence of finance and English is not required with the visa application, DHA retains the right to ask for financial evidence from any student if there is specific intelligence that suggests there may be a problem with the financial capacity of the student.

#### Regular Evidentiary Requirements

Regular applications require a student to present two extra pieces of evidence with their visa application: financial capacity and English language proficiency evidence.

#### Evidence of Financial Capacity

_Genuine Access Requirement_

To obtain an Australian student visa, applicants must demonstrate sufficient funds to  
cover:

  * Tuition fees for the first year of study
  * Living expenses for the first year in Australia
  * Travel costs for the student and any accompanying family members



All funds that can be accepted as evidence must be clearly available to the student in order to pay for their studies and living costs. The factors that may be considered include:

  * The relationship of the sponsor (e.g. a parent or guardian’s funds are appropriate, but “family friends” bank accounts are not normally acceptable)
  * Income, assets and employment history of sponsor/parent
  * Previous visa history of the student (e.g. have they have had difficulties in the past)



Students cannot rely on their ability to earn money through work in Australia as evidence of having funds.

The following are sources of evidence of financial capacity:

  * money deposit with a financial institution (bank)
  * loan with a financial institution (bank)
  * government loans
  * scholarship



There are three options to provide financial evidence.

**_Option 1: 12 months living expenses_**

Show evidence of funds for travel costs plus 12 months of living and tuition costs. As of 2024, the minimum funds required are:

  * AUD$29,710 for a single student
  * AUD$10,394 for a spouse or de-facto partner
  * AUD$4,449 per dependent child
  * AUD$13,502 per child for annual school costs 



**_NOTE: Estimated expenses change regularly.[Click here](https://ausimmi.com.au/500-calculator) for a reliable calculator of up to date expenses._**

If a student has dependants, they need to show access to relevant funds for the accompanying family unit (spouse and/or children).

Each school-age child requires enough funds for each year of schooling they will require (unless they have been provided with an exemption from a Government High School).

**_Option 2: Annual income of parents_**

Show evidence that the annual income of the student’s parents (combined if necessary) or spouse exceeds AUD$87,856 per year. If one or more members of the applicant’s family unit are seeking to satisfy the secondary criteria for the Student visa, they will need to demonstrate an income of AUD$102,500 per year.

This information must be provided on Government documentation (such as a tax return) which less than 12 months old.

**_Option 3: Secondary exchange students only_**

#### **English Language Proficiency Requirements**

DHA have designated certain English proficiency tests as acceptable and prescribe minimum standards. The minimum scores for various tests remain largely consistent, but it is essential to verify with individual institutions, as many require higher scores for admission than those set by DHA.
