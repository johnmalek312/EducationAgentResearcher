#### Packaging Offer Letters and The Principal Course

In many cases, a student comes to Australia with the intention of studying more than one course. Where the student intends to package courses to combine their preliminary course of study with their main course of study, the education provider evidentiary requirements rating applied to the Student visa application would correspond to the studentâ€™s main course of study (or principal course).

The principal course is the course that the student intends to undertake in Australia at the highest level. For example, a student may intend to study 3 courses in this order from lowest to highest level:

  1. An ELICOS program, then
  2. A foundation program, then
  3. An undergraduate program (the principal course).



If that student has a package of courses that provides clear course progression to the undergraduate degree, then the rating that corresponds to the provider of the undergraduate program will be applied in the visa process.

DHA will only recognise a package of offers if the student has a CoE (for applications made outside Australia) or a letter of offer (for applications made in Australia, noting a CoE will be needed before the visa can be granted) of a place into all the courses, including the highest-level course from the education institution(s). It is not enough that the student intends to continue to study at a higher level than the first course they undertake but does not have a CoE for the higher level course.

A letter of offer for a course can be conditional on the student successfully completing a previous course. In the above example, the student may have to successfully complete the foundation program before continuing to the undergraduate program.

A package of courses must also increase in level across the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). For example, a student cannot study a course of a lower level after one of a higher level.

#### Visa Duration

The duration of a Student Visa generally depends on the dates of study detailed in the CoEs that are submitted with the application. In general, the visa granted will cover the full length of every CoE that is in a sequence or package, if the evidences provided satisfy the visa requirements. The following table shows the general guidelines used:

**Duration of Course**| **Duration of Visa**  
---|---  
10 months or less| Student Visa normally granted for one month longer than the end date of the principal course  
Longer than 10 months| Student Visa normally granted for two months longer than the end date of the principal course, if it ends before November. If the course ends in November or December, the visa will normally cease on 15 March of the following year (about three months after)
