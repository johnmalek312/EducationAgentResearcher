__

The English language proficiency requirement for student visas has increased, with a**minimum score of 6.0 now required for most applicants**.

__

As of July 1, 2024, the base application fee for student visas will**increase to AUD $1,600** , with additional fees for applicants over and under 18.

#### Full Time Study

Only students who have enrolled in full-time study can apply for a Student visa, with the exception of Doctoral (PhD) students waiting for their thesis to be marked.

#### Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE)

The key integrity measure the Department of Home Affairs makes in granting a Student visa is whether the applicant is a genuine temporary entrant. That is, are they coming to Australia for genuine study purposes and have a realistic prospect of returning home once their studies have finished. DHA takes a balanced approach and will weigh up all the factors before making a decision.

Some factors that the department considers as part of the GTE requirement include:

  * the circumstances in the applicant’s home country
  * the applicant’s potential circumstances in Australia
  * the applicant’s immigration history
  * the value of the course to the applicant’s future
  * any other matter relevant to the applicant’s intention to stay temporarily



Examples of how a student might be considered not to be a Genuine Temporary Entrant are:

**GTE Considerations**| **Examples**  
---|---  
Circumstances in the applicant’s home country| Any matter, such as economic downturn , relevant to the applicant’s intention to stay temporarily  
The applicant’s potential circumstances in Australia| The student has been in Australia for extensive periods of time, either without having successfully completed a qualification, or has moved education providers on numerous occasions.  
The applicant’s immigration history| The student has had previous visa applications refused or visas cancelled.  
The value of the course to the applicant’s future| The student is applying for a course that is not related to their career choice or previous qualifications  
Any other matter that may be relevant| The student cannot explain how an Australian qualification will benefit them in the future  
  
#### 

#### Good Character

The student must make a declaration on the visa application form that includes but is not limited to the following:

  * they have not been involved in criminal activity, or
  * they have not been previously deported.

#### Health Requirement

The health of overseas students studying in Australia is important and protects the Australian community from public health and safety risks, particularly active tuberculosis.

To meet the health requirement, a student must be free from a disease or condition that is:

  * considered to be a threat to public health or a danger to the Australian community
  * likely to result in significant health care and community service costs to the Australian community
  * likely to require health care and community services that would limit the access of Australian citizens and permanent residents to those services already in short supply.



See details [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/health).

#### Health Examinations

A student may be required to undergo health examinations as part of the visa application process process, check the [Health Examinations](http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa/Heal/meeting-the-health-requirement/health-examinations) information on the DHA website. There are specific requirements for arranging a health examination. An online system known as eMedical processes health examinations results electronically and these are forwarded to DHA for assessment. If your student does require a medical examination outside of Australia, they must contact an Australian panel doctor in their country. A list of doctors is available from [Immigration Panel Doctors](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/health/arrange-your-health-examinations).

##### 

##### Risk of Tuberculosis (TB)

The following table shows how the risk of Tuberculosis (TB) in different countries impacts on the likelihood of the necessity of a medical examination. DHA may decide to request a health assessment regardless of the risk assessment detailed for TB below.

**Country TB Risk Level**| **Student to stay in Australia less than 6 months**| **Student to stay in Australia more than 6 months**  
---|---|---  
Low Risk| No health examination normally required| No health examination normally required  
High Risk| No health examination normally required| Medical examination requiredChest X-ray required (if over 11years old)

#### Health Insurance

Adequate health insurance is a mandatory visa condition. DHA requires evidence of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) to demonstrate that the student is adequately insured. There are some exceptions (for example, students from Norway, Belgium or Sweden who have acceptable health cover from their home country).

Often, the education provider will include the option to pay for health insurance in the enrolment fees and a CoE will indicate that the student has OSHC arranged. Students will need to provide details of their OSHC policy in their visa application. International students have the right to choose their OSHC provider, although their education provider may make specific recommendations to applicants because they have negotiated an arrangement with a particular insurer.

If the cost of health insurance is not included in enrolment fees, the student will need to obtain OSHC insurance and provide OSHC policy details in the application.

A student (and any accompanying family members) must have OSHC for proposed duration of their student visa. e.g. they must have OSHC taken out for the entire period from the date they arrive in Australia on their student visa to the expiry date of their student visa. 

Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) holders can obtain Overseas Visitors Health Cover (OVHC) that provides a similar level of cover. 

DHA have further information on their website [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/health/adequate-health-insurance) and the Department of Health [here](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-health-cover-oshc-resources).

#### No debts to the Australian Government

The student must not owe money to Australia, or have agreed repayment plans in place. A declaration on the application form will normally satisfy this requirement.
