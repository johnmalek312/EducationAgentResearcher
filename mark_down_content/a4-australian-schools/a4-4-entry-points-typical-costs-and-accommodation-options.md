### Entry Points for International Students

Entry points might be different depending on the school (government/non-government and/or the State it operates in), but commonly they are as follows:

### Primary Schools

  * Students may enter at Preparatory level or Year 1.
  * A student can enter at any year if the application is accepted by the school, and they have complete transcripts from their former school. In some instances they may be required to take a placement test to ensure their success at their new school.



### Secondary Schools

  * Students may enter Years 6 or 8 or at Years 10 or 11. The entry to these years reflects the beginning of the teaching/learning cycle, e.g. beginning of junior/senior high school)
  * A student may enter at any year if the application is accepted by the school, and with appropriate transcripts. New students need complete academic records and an appropriate English language proficiency.

There are several accommodation options for international students such as:

**Boarding school**

  * Many non-government secondary schools provide accommodation, meals and laundry services for international students. Tuition fees are in addition to the boarding fees.



**Homestay**

  * This is popular with younger students and those studying short-term English courses.
  * Students can live with an Australian family, gain access to the Australian lifestyle and practise English in a natural and friendly way.
  * Meals are usually included in the cost and single or shared rooms may be offered.
  * Self-catering homestay is sometimes available at a cheaper price.Education providers must ensure that homestay families are reputable, and that they offer good accommodation.



**Farmstay**

  * This offers the same or similar services as a homestay, but in a rural setting. It can be suitable for short stays.



**Share or Rental Accommodation**

  * Students over 18 may share or rent an apartment or house.
