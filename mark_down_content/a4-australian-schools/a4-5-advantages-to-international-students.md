Australia offers international students a high quality education in a safe and welcoming environment. International students have been enrolled in Australian schools since the 1950s. According to the  
latest data from the Australian Government’s Department of Education, there were approximately  
579,000 international student enrolments in Australia during the first half of 2023. This includes 50% in  
Higher Education, 39% in Vocational Education and Training (VET), 7% in English Language Intensive  
Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS), and 4% in primary and secondary schools. For the most  
current international student statistics, you can access updated data on the Australian Government’s  
education website.

Australian school education offers the opportunity for students to develop life skills in a positive and outgoing environment. Importance is given to personal development as well as academic studies.

Schools in Australia take great care in looking after their international students, helping them to adjust to the Australian way of life. The multicultural nature of Australian society means international students are readily accepted by other students. Teachers are experienced in teaching classes to students from many different countries and cultures.

Some schools and colleges cater exclusively for international students, whereas others have long traditions of student exchange with other international schools. In many cases students are able to maintain and develop their own language skills as well as become proficient in the English language.

There are three primary reasons that international students are attracted to studying in Australia:

  * Quality
  * English as a Second Language (ESL) Programs
  * Information and Communication Technology in Schools



### Quality

State and Territory Governments have agreed on a National Curriculum Framework for all Australian schools, that outlines national standards in key learning areas. This framework ensures that all students in Australian schools achieve the best possible outcomes.

The National Curriculum Framework is based on ten common and agreed national goals for schooling. The goals identify the skills, understanding, knowledge, attitudes and values which should be developed in young Australians. They focus on eight learning areas:

  * English
  * Mathematics
  * Science
  * Technology
  * Studies of Society and the Environment
  * Health and Physical Education
  * Languages other than English and
  * Arts.



### Comparisons with other countries

The latest PISA insights and interpretations showed that Australian students were above OECD averages in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy. The full detailed report of its findings can be found [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/PISA%202018%20Insights%20and%20Interpretations%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf).

### English as a Second Language (ESL) Programs

ESL programs in both primary and high schools are available for students whose first language is not English. The types of ESL students range from those newly arrived in Australia and beginning to learn English to Australian-born students from a non-English speaking background.

In general, ESL support can:

  * prepare students for entry into school studies in intensive English courses,
  * provide ongoing language-support programs for students after they begin their formal studies



Parents of international students have access to translation and interpreter services in the public school system.

### Information and Communication Technology in Schools

Australian schools aim to produce graduates who are able to use information and communication technology (ICT) effectively in all aspects of their lives. This means that all students leave school as confident, creative and productive users of new technologies and understand the impact of those technologies on society.

Australian schools are becoming world leaders in the application of technology to education and they are well-equipped with the following:

  * Computers
  * Digital data and communication links
  * Film and television
  * Satellite signals to remote locations
  * Internet access points and
  * Online courses and materials.
