Two qualifications are available from secondary schools:

### 1\. A Certificate of Completion of Year 10

This is usually an informal certificate, but some states offer formal qualifications at this level.

Students with a certificate of completion for Year 10 may start to work or begin a vocational education program. They will not generally be accepted into a university program, but may seek mature age entry to some universities later.

Some schools also teach vocational subjects and issue credit towards Certificates I-IV, which are normally obtained through the Vocational Education and Training (VET) System.

### 2\. A Senior Certificate of Secondary Education

This is a formal certificate known by different names as follows:

**STATE / TERRITORY**| **SENIOR SECONDARY CERTIFICATE OF EDUCATION**  
---|---  
Australian Capital Territory (ACT)| ACT Year 12 Certificate  
New South Wales (NSW)| Higher School Certificate (HSC)  
Northern Territory (NT)| Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE)  
Queensland (QLD)| Senior Certificate  
South Australia (SA)| South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE)  
Tasmania (TAS)| Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE)  
Victoria (VIC)| Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE)  
Western Australia (WA)| WA Certificate of Education (WACE)  
  
Students with a Senior Certificate of Secondary Education have more choices, and they may decide to:

  * start work,
  * begin a VET program,
  * progress directly to university studies.



Some schools offer foundation programs to international students instead of a senior certificate. This normally provides entry to specific universities.

### Student Ranking

Students who seek admission to higher education and universities are provided with a tertiary entrance score or rank. A studentâ€™s rank:

  * is calculated in each State & Territory with its own name and system. For example, in Queensland it is called the ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) Score.
  * is based on the grades achieved through school assessment and the final exam marks.
  * is used by the higher education authorities to determine if the student meets the admission requirements for its courses.
