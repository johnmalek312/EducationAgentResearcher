The examples below demonstrate the concerns that have been identified in some circumstances when processing Student visas.

#### 1\. English language skills

A visa applicant, who did not have the English language skills to meet the visa requirements, arranged for an impostor to sit the English language test on their behalf. DHA identified this fraud through (a) a facial comparison of the photo on the test results with another photo of the applicant; (b) an interview with the applicant which indicated a low level of English proficiency and (c) verification of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score online. While DHA has processes in place to detect and take action against English test fraud, education providers normally check off test results using the online verification tools available from the test providers.

#### 2\. Genuine student/temporary entrant

A DHA case officer had to consider a Student visa application concerning an applicant from a country with high unemployment, who had strong family ties to Australia and who had not studied for a significant period of time. The case officer requested an interview with the applicant to obtain further information. At the interview, the applicant was unable to explain why he had chosen his proposed course and provider and how the course would benefit him. Given the applicant’s low employment prospects in his country of origin, strong ties to Australia and the applicant’s inability to provide basic information regarding his proposed course of study, the application was refused.

#### 3\. Family background and financial support

A DHA case officer received an application in which the student’s parents claimed to be in high-paying jobs in a reputable industry. The case officer requested an integrity check on the application as these claims were uncommon in the region from which the visa applicant came. The officer was able to identify that the student’s parents did not have sufficient funds to contribute towards the student’s expenses. The application was refused as the case officer was not satisfied the applicant had sufficient funds to support himself in his studies onshore and, therefore, was not planning to come to Australia with the genuine intention to study.

#### 4\. Document fraud

An overseas post identified an offshore website which claimed to be selling high quality forgeries of academic transcripts for use in migration applications. In these cases, DHA officers are briefed on the basic characteristics of the forged documents and arrangements are put in place to verify qualifications with the issuing education providers.
