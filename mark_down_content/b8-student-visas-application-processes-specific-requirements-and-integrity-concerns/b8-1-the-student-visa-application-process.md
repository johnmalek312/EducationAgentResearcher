#### Check Required Evidence using the Document Checklist Tool

This tool provides a guide as to the documents that a student should provide with their student visa application. The student (or agent) enters both the student’s country of citizenship and the education provider they will be studying their principal program with. The evidence requirements will be displayed.

The tool will not identify whether an application is streamlined or regular, it will provide guidance as to what documents need to be provided with the application, noting that DHA can request additional information where necessary. 

See the link [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/web-evidentiary-tool).

#### Lodging An Application via  _immiAccount_

#### **Points to Note**

  1. As of July 1, 2024, the base application fee for student visas will increase to AUD $1,600, with additional fees for applicants over and under 18.
  2. International students **outside** Australia must be enrolled in a registered course of study and provide a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) when they lodge their Student visa application.
  3. Students **in** Australia may still apply with a letter of offer or a CoE but must obtain a CoE to be granted the visa.
  4. Students must apply using the online form 157A (internet). Where an applicant encounters a technical difficulty, they will be able to lodge an online technical support form. 
  5. **All** students complete the same form. Students are asked to enter information about their financial and English proficiency regardless of whether they have streamlined or regular evidentiary requirements. While some questions are non-mandatory for streamlined students, it may make the application process quicker in some cases for the student to provide any English proficiency information to support the student’s GTE assessment.
