### School Sector

#### Age Requirements

There are age limits set for international students intending to study in the School sector.

These are the age requirements that apply:

  * A primary school student must be at least 6 years of age.



Secondary students must:

  * be less than 17 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 9
  * be less than 18 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 10
  * be less than 19 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 11
  * be less than 20 years old when commencing the Academic year Grade 12



#### Visa Grant period

A primary school student will only be granted a visa for a maximum period of two years. This requirement will assist to manage the welfare and immigration risks association with younger students. Note: If a student enrols mid-year, the visa will be granted for a maximum of two and a half years.

Further, a student intending to study in Australia from primary school and through secondary school will not meet the GTE requirement. This is because integration into their home country will be unlikely after completing their formative education in Australia.

This does not prevent a student from applying for a further visa for two years after completing two years of primary school, however GTE will be closely assessed. 

#### Secondary exchange students

Secondary exchange students have an option of providing a completed AASES form as meeting their financial evidence and welfare arrangements requirement.

School students are exempt from providing evidence of English language proficiency.

### Other Matters

#### ELICOS Courses

There is no limitation on the maximum duration of ELICOS study that may be undertaken. Genuine students will be able to undertake as much ELICOS study as either a standalone course or prior to their principal course, as required.

#### Family Members

Students have to declare all family members on their visa application, if not, these family members wonâ€™t be able to travel to Australia to visit at a later stage.

DHA require the financial details for the subsequent entry of family members. Not only for the person applying for the visa, but also including sufficient funds to cover their whole family unit in Australia. E.g. If my wife is on a Student visa in Australia and I apply to join her, DHA will look at the combined financial capacity for both my wife and my living expenses and also her course fees as well.

#### Guardian Visas (Subclass 590)

The Student Guardian visa (Subcless 590) is for foreign nationals applying to stay in Australia as the guardian of an under 18 student.The student must not remain in Australia when their guardian is not in Australia unless there is an alternative welfare arrangement in place. In some special circumstances, guardian visas can be obtained to look after students who are over 18 years old.

All applicants for a Student Guardian visa must have sufficient funds to support themselves, the nominating student(s) and any secondary applicants for the duration of their intended stay in Australia.

Under the SSVF, the single immigration risk framework will not apply to Student Guardian visa applicants. Rather, all guardians must provide evidence of their financial capacity with their visa application.

Evidence of financial capacity can be provided in either of the following forms:

  * Evidence of annual income of $70,000 or more; or
  * Evidence of sufficient funds to cover travel costs, and the first 12 months living costs for themselves and each dependent child included in the application.



Subsequent applications by family members of guardians will not be accepted. Guardians wishing to bring additional family members under six years of age to Australia must apply for a new Student Guardian visa for themselves and these students.
