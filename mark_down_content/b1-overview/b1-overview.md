#### Significant Changes in Visa Processes in 2016

There were significant changes to Visa processes in 2016 that simplified application processes for students and targeted immigration integrity. International students apply for a single [Student visa (subclass 500)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500) regardless of their chosen course of study. Student guardians will apply for the [Student Guardian visa (subclass 590)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-590). A single evidence level framework applies to all international students. All students and student guardians will generally be required to lodge their visa application online by creating an account in [ImmiAccount](https://online.immi.gov.au/lusc/login). (see also B2.4)

Student visa applicants must have sufficient funds available for the duration of their stay in Australia and should not rely on work to support themselves or family while in Australia.

All student visa (subclass 500) holders must maintain enrolment at the same level or a higher Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level for which they were granted a visa, unless they are undertaking a doctoral degree (AQF10) and transfer to a masterâ€™s degree (AQF9).  
Transferring to a lower AQF level course or transferring from an AQF level course to a non-AQF Award course is a breach of the student visa condition and might result in the visa being cancelled.
