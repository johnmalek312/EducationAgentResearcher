### Certificates

The general aims of Certificate level courses are to:

  * prepare candidates for both employment and further education and training and
  * recognise skills and knowledge that meet national industry standards.



Certificates I and II are qualifications which recognise the students’ basic vocational skills and knowledge.

Certificates III and IV are the equivalent of trade certificates in various vocations. These prepare students for both employment and further education and training in their chosen field.

### Diplomas

Diploma courses aim to:

  * prepare students to use their skills and knowledge based on fundamental principles and complex techniques and
  * recognise the ability to show initiative and judgment across a broad range of technical and management functions.



The Advanced Diploma is a more specialised qualification that shows skill and knowledge of a greater complexity and a higher level of personal accountability.

Note that some TAFE institutes and private providers also offer programs above Diploma level.
