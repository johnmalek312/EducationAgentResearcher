Vocational Education and Training provides a number of significant advantages to students:

  * It gives students access to many job opportunities after as little as ten months of training.
  * It offers students more job opportunities and higher earnings based on their improved qualifications.
  * Students can develop both practical and professional skills that are taught by industry experienced instructors.
  * About 70 to 80% of employers are very satisfied with VET training since it provides students with appropriate skills, which leads to increased productivity.
  * The vocational and practical nature of VET curricula places less pressure on students with lower levels of English proficiency. This gives these students more time to develop their language skills before undertaking academic level studies if they wish to continue.
