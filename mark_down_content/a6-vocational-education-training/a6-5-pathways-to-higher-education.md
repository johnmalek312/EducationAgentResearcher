A major strength of the VET system is that it provides an alternative pathway to higher education or more specialised vocational training.

AQF qualifications link with each other in a range of learning pathways between schools, VET providers and universities. This encourages cross-sectoral linkage programs such as:

  * **VET in Schools**. This allows schools to offer industry based units of learning that can contribute to both the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education and Certificate I – IV qualifications
  * **Articulation and Credit Transfer Arrangements** between registered VET providers and universities. This involves the efficient articulation of programs and maximum credit transfer
  * **Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)**. This is when credits are granted towards qualifications through assessment of an individual’s knowledge and skills gained through education, training, work and life experience.



The AQF pathways diagram is shown here:

In addition, the pathway from university to vocational education and training qualifications is becoming increasingly popular. This enables students to gain industry experience needed to increase their employment opportunities.
