Each course has a unique Course Code. Some courses can be listed more than once with different CRICOS numbers.

Some courses may seem to be the same but if they have different [CRICOS Course Codes](https://cricos.education.gov.au/Course/CourseSearch.aspx), the length of the course, course cost, or the entrance requirements may be different.

### Why do you need to be careful with Course Numbers?

Itâ€™s important that when you talk with a prospective student, you use the correct CRICOS Course Code. This means you can be sure you are referring to the relevant course information.
