Each institution is given a unique [CRICOS Provider Code](https://cricos.education.gov.au/institution/InstitutionSearch.aspx) on registration. This code identifies the institution as a registered provider of education and training services to overseas students. Providers are required by law to include their provider code in all marketing material. For example, an institutionâ€™s website usually shows the code at the bottom of each web page.

### Why is the CRICOS Provider Code important?

  * It identifies the education institution as a registered provider of education and training to overseas students.
  * It clarifies who is legally responsible for provider obligations under the ESOS Act. This is important both for students and agents.
  * Where more than one provider is involved in the delivery of a course, only one provider is registered on CRICOS to deliver the course. The CRICOS Code ensures clarity about who is responsible for any obligation under the ESOS Act and the National Code 2007.  
For example, a university may enter into an approved arrangement for a college to run one of its courses on its behalf or a number of institutions may form a partnership to offer a particular course. The registered provider will be responsible for all the obligations under the ESOS legislation.
