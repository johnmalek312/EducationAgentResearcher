### Qualifications

Humanities, Social Science and Education programs are offered at the following qualification levels:

  * Certificate
  * Diploma
  * Advanced Diploma
  * Bachelor Degree
  * Graduate Certificate
  * Postgraduate Diploma
  * Masters by research/coursework
  * PhD



TAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational programs through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. These allow students to gain practical job skills, typically in Community Services and General Studies. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs.

Many of these programs allow graduates to work as accredited professionals. There are, however, some exceptions. Some TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs and universities, Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.

### Vocational Education and Training (VET) Programs

Vocational education programs in the Humanities, Social Science and Education discipline are offered either directly through TAFEs and private colleges or through traineeships and internships. Examples of courses include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Certificate| Certificate III in Community Services (Aged Care).  
Diploma| Diploma of Language;  
Diploma of Outdoor Recreation;  
Diploma of Theology.  
Advanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.  
  
Entry requirements vary but typically admission into Community Welfare and Counselling programs are higher than the General Education programs, where audition or portfolios are sometime required for admission. For example:

  * **Certificate III in Library/Information Services** – typically this course is suitable for any person wanting to work in libraries and information services.
  * **Diploma of Children’s Services** – students generally must articulate from the Certificate IV course into this program. Applicants generally must attain Government certification for working with children.
  * **Advanced Diploma of Interpreting (Professional)** – admission to this course is typically through articulation from the relevant Diploma. Other institutions require applicants to be accredited as a paraprofessional interpreter by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters ([NAATI](http://www.naati.com.au/)), have practical interpreting work experience, and complete prerequisite subjects for entry.



### University Programs

Universities usually offer a wide range of specialist and general programs within the Humanities, Social Science and Education disciplines. A number of these programs lead to accreditation as professionals. Examples of degrees include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Bachelor of Arts;  
Bachelor of Psychology;  
Bachelor of Social Work;  
Bachelor of Education;  
Bachelor of TESOL;  
Postgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Sociology;  
Postgraduate Diploma of Theology;  
Masters of Professional Ethics and Governance;  
PhD.  
  
### Undergraduate

Admission into the Humanities, Social Science and Education programs varies. Typically, general education programs offered as a major through Bachelor of Arts have lower entry requirements than the more specialised programs such as Psychology, Education and Social Work. Some programs do require students to have completed prerequisite subjects for admissions.

Examples of admission levels include:

  * **Bachelor of Arts** – 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 8 points at A Levels. Some institutions require prerequisite courses for admission depending on the chosen specialisation.
  * **Bachelor of Social Work** – 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 9 points at A Levels. Some universities only offer graduate entry programs. Students are required to have completed an Australian Bachelor Degree or equivalent for admission.
  * **Bachelor of Psychology** – 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 12 points at A Levels.



The majority of specialised programs offered through universities involve a practical component. An example of this is teacher training for Bachelor of Education and placements for Bachelor of Psychology and Social Work.

Students enrolling in a Bachelor of Education are usually required to enrol in a dual degree in their preferred teaching area. For example, a student wanting to teach mathematics might enrol in Bachelor of Education/Bachelor of Science (Mathematics).

Alternatively, some institutions offer graduate entry Bachelor of Education courses. These are designed for students who have completed a general Bachelor Degree and would like to earn the qualifications to allow them to teach in that area.

### Postgraduate

At a postgraduate level a number of institutions offer conversion programs for students who have completed a non-related undergraduate program and wish to change careers.

Advanced postgraduate coursework and research programs are also offered. Postgraduate research programs usually require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree with Honours I or II. Select universities do have pathways available to students wishing to complete a research degree without Honours.

A number of pathways link VET with university studies in the Humanities, Social Science and Education disciplines.
