### Specialisations

Urban/Regional/Rural Planning;  
Urban Studies;  
Environmental Planning;  
Town Planning;

### Qualifications

Architecture and Building programs are offered at the following qualification levels:

Certificate

Diploma

Advanced Diploma

Bachelor Degree

Graduate Certificate

Postgraduate Diploma

Masters by research/coursework

PhD

TAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational programs through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. These allow students to become tradespeople and gain practical job skills. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs. These programs allow students to practise as professional Architects, Urban Planners and Surveyors.

There are, however, some exceptions. Some TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs and universities Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.

### Vocational Education and Training Programs

TAFE and private colleges offer programs in specific trades associated with the building construction industry. These are offered as traditional programs as well as through traineeships where students learn on-the-job.

Examples of programs offered at this level include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Certificate| Certificate IV in Architectural Technology;  
Certificate IV in Building.  
Diploma| Diploma of Building Design;  
Diploma of Interior Design.  
Advanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Building Design.  
  
Entry requirements vary but typically admission into architectural and design programs are higher than the trade based programs. For example:

  * **Certificate IV in Carpentry** – students generally must have completed equivalent to Australian grade 10 (such as Mathayom Suksa Yr 5; O Levels; Taiwanese High School: SMA).
  * **Diploma of Building** – requires completion of Australian grade 12 or equivalent (A Levels, International Baccalaureate or Canadian OAC).



### University Programs

Completion of an Architecture, Planning or Development Degree at university level allows students to practise as professionals in their chosen field. Examples of university level programs include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Bachelor of Architecture;  
Bachelor of Arts (Architectural Studies);  
Bachelor of Science;  
Bachelor of Town Planning;  
Bachelor of Urban and Regional Planning.  
Postgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Development Planning;  
Postgraduate Diploma of Project Management;  
Masters of Regional Development;  
Masters of Architecture; and  
PhD.  
  
### Undergraduate

Requirements for entry into specialised programs such as Bachelor of Architecture are generally higher than Bachelor of Arts or Science majoring in Architecture or Urban Planning. However, completion of the latter program would not give students accreditation to practise as a professional. Examples of admission requirements include:

Bachelor of Architecture – 5 points at A Level in a minimum of two subjects to 11 points at A Levels. Some competitive courses also require students to produce a portfolio to be considered for admission.

Most university programs in Architecture, Urban Planning and Town Planning include a practical internship. This provides students with essential hands-on experience before graduation.

### Postgraduate

Examples of admission requirements are as follows:

  * **Masters of Architecture** – A relevant Australian Bachelor Degree or equivalent plus a design portfolio.
  * **Masters of Urban and Regional Planning** – entry requirements range from an Australian Bachelor Degree or equivalent in a relevant field, to an Australian postgraduate degree or equivalent in a relevant field plus at least two years work experience.



### Pathways

Very few pathways are available for students wanting to transfer their credits and qualifications from the VTE sector to University sector. Pathways do exist within TAFE and private colleges to articulate between Certificate, Diploma and Advanced Diploma. Similar pathways exist in universities for students wishing to upgrade from Graduate Certificates to Postgraduate Diplomas to Masters and PhD.
