### **Vocational Education and Training Programs**

TAFE and private colleges offer a wide range of practical Health programs including:

  * Community Health;
  * Dental Health;
  * Alternative Therapies – such as herbal medicine, shiatsu, remedial medicine, naturopathy and massage;

  * **Diploma of Nursing Care** – in some cases, entry requires:  
– a pre-selection test through [VETASSESS](https://www.vetassess.com.au/);  
– a current first aid certificate:  
– completion of Australian grade 12 or equivalent (A Levels, International Baccalaureate or Canadian OAC).
  * **Diploma of Applied Science** – requires completion of equivalent to Australian grade 12 (A Levels, International Baccalaureate or Canadian OAC).



### University Programs

Medical programs at universities have limited places and high entry requirements. Some streams will require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree before being admitted.

Note that the English language requirements are usually higher for programs in the Health field. For example, the English language proficiency requirements for the University of Queensland can be found [here](https://study.uq.edu.au/admissions/english-language-requirements).

Examples of programs offered by universities include:

**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Bachelor of Nursing;  
Bachelor of Dentistry;  
Bachelor of Occupational Therapy;  
Bachelor of Pharmacy;  
Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS);  
Bachelor of Health Science.  
Postgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Health Services Management;  
Masters of Mental Health Nursing;  
Masters of Nutrition and Dietetics;  
Masters by research of Public Health;  
PhD.  
  
### Undergraduate

Examples of typical entry requirements are:

  * **Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)** – has the highest entry requirement of any Health discipline course. Requirements range from admission on the basis of a Bachelor Degree, interview and completion of a Medical pre-admission test such as the GAMSAT or MCAT to the top 1% of school leavers. This equates to 13 points from A Levels. Students enrolling in the MBBS also have to complete clinical and practical training before being allowed to practise as a Doctor.
  * **Bachelor of Dentistry** – also has limited places and very high entry requirements. At some universities students enrol in a pre-dentistry program during their first year. Admittance into Bachelor of Dentistry is then based on their performance.
  * **Bachelor of Pharmacy, Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy** – also have high entry requirements and limited places, however students are generally assessed for admission on the basis of their high school results.
  * Nursing and Health Administration courses have relatively lower entry requirements. For example, **Bachelor of Nursing** – entry requirements range from completion of Australian grade 12 (or equivalent) with one prerequisite subject from Biology, Chemistry or Physics to excellent grades from Australian grade 12 or equivalent.
