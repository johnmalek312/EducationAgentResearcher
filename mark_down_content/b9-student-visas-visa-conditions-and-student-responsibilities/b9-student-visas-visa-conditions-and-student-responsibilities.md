### Overview

When students come to Australia, they need to understand the conditions and obligations of their Student visa.

To advise students correctly, you need to be aware of:

  * The conditions that a Student visa may contain;
  * The responsibilities that students have to comply with whilst they are studying;
  * Other related issues such as working, travelling and staying in Australia after a course finishes.



You should study these lessons along with the information from DHA regarding Studying in Australia [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500#About).

#### _Focus Questions_

  * What do visa conditions mean?
  * What are the requirements of Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)?
  * How do the roles and responsibilities of education agents in Australia differ from those for Registered Migration Agents (RMAs)?
