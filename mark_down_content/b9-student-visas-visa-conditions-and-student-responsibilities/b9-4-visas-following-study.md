#### Overview

A student may wish to remain in Australia to work after their course has finished. A student visa entitles a person to come to Australia on a temporary basis for a specified period to undertake study at an Australian educational institution. While many overseas students make a decision to apply for permanent residence upon completing their studies, this is an entirely separate process and there is no guarantee that, on the basis of having held a student visa, a person will meet the requirements to be granted permanent residence.

There is the opportunity for graduating students who meet particular criteria to stay in Australia and work temporarily. The information that follows is a summary and you should refer to the [DHA website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-finder) for further detail.

#### Temporary Graduate Visa (subclass 485)

In order to remain in Australia after studies, a student can obtain a Temporary Graduate visa. This visa has two streams: the Graduate Work stream and the Post-Study Work stream.

The Graduate Work stream is the same as the previous Skilled Graduate visa (subclass 485) for international students who have recently graduated with skills and qualifications that relate to an occupation on Australia’s Skilled Occupation List (SOL). The duration of this visa is typically 18 months, but it can be extended for certain graduates.

The Post-Study Work stream offers extended options for working in Australia to eligible graduates of a higher education degree. Under this stream, successful applicants are granted a visa of two, three or four years duration, depending on the highest educational qualification they have obtained.

As of March 23, 2024, significant changes were made to the Temporary Graduate visa:

  * The age limit for applicants has been reduced from 50 years to 35 years.
  * The English language proficiency requirement has been increased for applications lodged on or after this date.
  * There are provisions allowing for additional time on the visa for graduates from regional institutions.



**_Australian study requirement_**

All subclass 485 visa applicants must meet the Australian study requirement in the six months immediately prior to making their application, regardless of the stream that they are assessed under.

Students must have:

  * attained either a single qualification requiring at least two academic years study or multiple qualifications resulting in a total period of at least two academic years study;
  * undertaken this study in no less than 16 months;
  * lodged their application within six months of completing their course (when they received their results not the Graduation ceremony).



To meet this requirement, the course/courses must also:

  * be on CRICOS
  * have been successfully completed
  * have resulted in an eligible qualification
  * have had all instruction in English
  * have been completed while physically in Australia
  * have been completed while holding a visa allowing study in Australia be counted only once towards the Australian study requirement.
  * not be an English language proficiency course or enabling program.



Two academic years study is defined as 92 weeks of study in a course or courses registered by CRICOS. CRICOS defines a number of weeks for each course. Students may take longer to complete their course, but will only be credited with the number of weeks that CRICOS determines as a standard duration. Only study that is successfully completed counts towards the two academic years. Students may meet the two year academic study requirement when completing a course that is longer than two years.

Credits for prior learning may reduce the amount of study undertaken. Credit granted on the basis of study undertaken in Australia in a course registered with CRICOS may contribute towards meeting the Australian study requirement, but only once.

There is further information on the [DHA website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-finder)

#### Graduate work stream

Relevant to international students with an eligible qualification who graduate with skills and qualifications that relate to an occupation on the [Skilled Occupation List (SOL)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/skill-occupation-list). A visa in this stream is granted for 18 months.

Eligible qualifications can be a degree, diploma or trade qualification and the qualifications must be closely related to the student’s nominated skilled occupation. This means the subject matter and the skills gained from the qualifications can be applied at the level achieved in the nominated skilled occupation.

Example: Acceptable combinations of study and nominated occupations include:

  * an applicant who nominates ‘Physiotherapist’ as their skilled occupation and completes a degree in physiotherapy in Australia
  * an applicant who nominates ‘Air-conditioning and Mechanical Services Plumber’ as their skilled occupation who has completed a Certificate III in Plumbing and a Diploma of Plumbing and Services in Australia



Example: A combination of study and nominated occupation that would not be acceptable:

  * An applicant’s nominated occupation is Registered Nurse but they completed a Bachelor of Commerce.



Note that the Skilled Occupations List (SOL) changes regularly and occupations that may have been listed when a student commenced their course, may no longer be on the list when they graduate.

#### Post-study work stream

For international students with an eligible qualification. A visa in this stream is granted for 2-4 years. Eligible qualifications:

  * Bachelor degree (2 years work rights)
  * Bachelor (honours) degree (2 years work rights)
  * Masters by coursework degree (2 years work rights)
  * Masters (extended) degree (2 years work rights)
  * Masters by research degree (3 years work rights)
  * Doctoral degree. (4 years work rights)



Note: Study resulting in a diploma level qualification or trade qualification is NOT eligible.

All courses must have been undertaken at an Australian university or education provider accredited to offer degree level programs.

#### Migrate to Australia under the General Skilled Migration (GSM)

It is important to note that student visas are aimed at achieving an educational outcome. General Skilled Migration (GSM) on the other hand is predominantly driven by the labour market needs of Australia.

The criteria for grant of GSM visas can change in response to the changing economic circumstances of Australia. All applicants seeking to be granted a permanent GSM visa must meet the relevant criteria set out in the Migration legislation, regardless of whether or not they have previously been in Australia. It is important for student visa holders to note that any changes to the criteria for the grant of a GSM visa would not affect their Student visa conditions.

Note: If you are an agent working in Australia, you must be a Registered Migration Agent (RMA) to provide immigration advice.
