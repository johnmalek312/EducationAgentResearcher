An agent needs to inform their students that:

  * They cannot expect to meet their tuition fees from the work they undertake in Australia; There is no guarantee that suitable work will be available;
  * Working may help them financially, but it is unlikely to provide substantial funds.
  * Working in Australia gives them the same rights and protections in the workplace as any Australian citizen.



##### _Student Visa Holder_

Student visas are granted with permission to work. As a result, student visa holders (and their family members travelling with them) do not need to apply for permission to work separately once they arrive in Australia.

As of July 1, 2023, student visa holders can work up to 48 hours per fortnight while their course is in session and can work unlimited hours during recognized school breaks.

**_NOTE: There are temporary work rights that should be included in this section, see:<https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/temporary-relaxation-of-working-hours-for-student-visa-holders>_**

A student’s course is considered to be ‘in session’:

  * for the duration of the advertised semesters (including periods when exams are being held);
  * if the studies have been completed but the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is still in effect, and
  * if a student is undertaking another course during a break from their main course and the points will be credited towards their main course.



Note: The student cannot undertake work until they have commenced their course in Australia. DHA considers work to also include some volunteer work or unpaid work. If a student is doing voluntary, unpaid work, it is not included in the limit of 48 hours per fortnight if it:

  * is of benefit to the community
  * is for a non-profit organisation
  * would not otherwise be undertaken in return for wages by an Australian resident (that is, it is a designated volunteer position), and
  * is genuinely voluntary (that is, no remuneration, either in cash or kind is received, – board and lodging acceptable).



These conditions do not apply to work that is required as part of a student’s course. The educational institution will advise a student if this is the case.

##### _Dependent of the student holder_

A dependent of a student visa holder is subject to condition 8104 which permits the holder to work a maximum of 48 hours per fortnight once the student (main applicant) has commenced their course. If the student’s course of study is a course for the award of a masters or doctorate degree that is registered on CRICOS, a dependent may work unlimited hours.

##### _Helping students understand their rights at work_

The Australian Government is committed to helping protect international students during their time in Australia, including in workplaces. To make sure that international students are treated fairly at work, including being paid the right amount and on time, students need to know what rights they have in Australian workplaces.
