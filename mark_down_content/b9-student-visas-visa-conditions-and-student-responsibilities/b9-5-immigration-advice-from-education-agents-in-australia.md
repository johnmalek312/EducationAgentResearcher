The Migration Act 1958 states that it is necessary for individuals who provide immigration advice to others for a fee to be registered as migration agents (RMAs) by the Office of the Migration Agent Registration Authority ([O](https://www.mara.gov.au/)[MARA](https://www.mara.gov.au/)).

This legislation does not apply to education agents outside Australia.

Education agents in Australia (not overseas):

  * Must limit their advice about immigration matters to explaining information that is publicly available (on the DIBP website for example).
  * Must not provide substantial comment on the information other than to help the student understand the information if English is not the student’s first language.
  * Should limit their advice to student issues alone.
  * Can assist in completing student visa applications for their students and act as a point of contact for DHA during the progress of an application.



If you are an education agent working **in Australia** you can help your students by:

  * posting or delivering a visa application to the department on behalf of your student
  * undertaking clerical work to prepare, or help prepare a visa application
  * providing translation or interpretation services to help prepare a visa application
  * advising your student that he or she must have a visa to stay in Australia
  * passing on information from a third party, without comment or explanation, e.g. information publicly available from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection
  * being nominated to receive correspondence on behalf of your student.



Registered Migration Agents undergo a rigorous registration process and continuing professional development. This is because of the large number of visa types and the frequent changing of visa regulations and conditions. So, education agents who are not RMAs are not equipped to understand the factors that impact on an individual’s migration plans.

Education agents in Australia who are not RMAs should not attempt to:

  * Case manage a student’s application for permanent residence,
  * Provide any detailed analysis of a student’s migration pathway.



It is a criminal offence **in Australia** to give immigration advice if an individual is not an RMA.

You need to put a student in contact with a Registered Migration Agent as quickly as possible if:

  * The student is having significant difficulty in complying with their visa conditions, or
  * The student has received a notice of visa breach.  
Any appeal needs to be lodged within a strict time limit.
