For Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students to achieve the intended purposes of the ESOS Act, the legislation provides a [National Code of Practice.](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01182)

The National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) supports the National Strategy for International Education 2025 to advance Australia as a global leader in education, training and research.  
  
The National Code is a legislative instrument made under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and sets nationally consistent standards to support providers to deliver quality education and training to overseas students.

**How does The National Code relate to Agents?**

An agent’s behaviour is the direct responsibility of the education provider. So if you make a mistake or behave dishonestly, the education provider will be held responsible for your actions. The National Code 2018 also requires that providers have a written agreement with all education agents they engage to formally represent them. The agreement must contain corrective actions and termination conditions.

The National Code is arranged in two parts. Part A describes the framework of the ESOS Framework. Part B contains the detailed Standards.

The links below provide fact sheets and summaries of the 11 National Code Standards.
