### Overview

The Privacy Act was passed by Federal Parliament in 1988. This legislation relates to all people in Australia, and applies to people working with international students. Privacy laws can determine what information can or cannot be provided to an agent.

If a student reasonably believes they have not received acceptable services they can make a complaint or if they have received a negative decision they can lodge an appeal. This section will consider the common complaints and the processes to be followed.

### Focus Questions

  1. How should a studentâ€™s private information be collected and used?
  2. How do privacy laws relate to students aged 18 or over?
  3. How do privacy laws relate to medical situations?
  4. What do students complain about?
  5. What mechanisms are available to make a complaint for an international student in Australia?
