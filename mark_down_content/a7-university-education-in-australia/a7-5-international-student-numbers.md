Australia has for many years welcomed overseas students into Australian universities. Many leaders of business, government, the military and even the nobility from many countries, especially in the Asian region, have studied and obtained their qualifications in Australian universities. Australia is now a world leader in the provision of education to overseas students, who study at all levels within Australian universities and in all disciplines.

The Australian Department of Education provides excellent up-to-date information on international education enrolment. Their research snapshots are very informative, easy to read and updated regularly. Find the latest information [here](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-monthly-summary-and-data-tables#toc-international-student-data-full-year-data-based-on-data-finalised-in-december-2023-).

The Australian government has proposed a cap of 270,000 new international student commencements for the year 2025, which is intended to restore numbers to pre-pandemic levels. This cap will apply to both higher education and vocational education sectors, excluding primary and secondary schools as well as standalone English-language providers.

  * Public universities will have a combined cap of approximately 145,000 new international students.
  * The vocational education sector is allocated 95,000 spots.
  * Private universities and non-higher education providers will receive around 30,000 places.
