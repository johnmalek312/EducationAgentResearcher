Some of the measures that operate to safeguard and improve quality of Australiaâ€™s Universities include:

  * The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency ([TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/))


  * Universities Australia ([Universities Australia](http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/))

TEQSA is an independent body with powers to regulate university and non-university higher education providers, monitor quality and set standards. TEQSA registers providers, carries out evaluations of standards and performance, protects and assures the quality of international education and streamlines current regulatory arrangements.

Universities Australia is the peak body representing Australian Universities and operates a **[National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students (2018)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01182)**. 

The code provides ethical practice guidelines for universities about promotion and marketing and agents and partners. It also provides information about:

  * the admission of students,
  * arrival and orientation,
  * student support,
  * fee-charging and refunds,
  * university infrastructure,
  * returning home support.



The Code of Practice provides overseas students with clear assurances in respect of:

  * maintaining academic standards,
  * being accurate and honest in the provision of information to prospective students,
  * the welfare of international students,
  * being sensitive to the culture, customs and linguistic needs and characteristics of international students,
  * delivering to students the commitments made to them by education agents or others representing the University,
  * the refund policy for overseas students.
