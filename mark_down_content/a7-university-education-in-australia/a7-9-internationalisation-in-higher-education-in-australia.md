Internationalisation is developing within higher education in the following areas:

**AREA**| **DEVELOPMENT**  
---|---  
**Curriculum**|  Many degrees have learning materials that reflect:  


  * the international content of subject matter and
  * the possible international profile of students undertaking a program.

  
**Student mobility & exchange**| Most universities are promoting the benefits of:  


  * domestic students undertaking a portion of their studies (and work experience) in another country,
  * international students undertaking their ‘study abroad’ in Australia.

  
**Institutional partnerships**| 

  * Universities have formed a number of international groups and bi-lateral arrangements to collaborate in research and increasingly in the delivery of specified programs.
  * Private providers tend to be forming partnerships with public universities that target the international education market.

  
**International Students**| 

  * International students have become very visible on Australian campuses and they represent from 10% to 30% of the total student population.
  * Some universities have specific campuses that are predominately populated by international students.
  * International alumni associations have become important both in recruitment and in advocating for a particular institution.

  
**Structural administration**| 

  * While Universities have a variety of administrative structures, their international activities are headed by a senior management position such as Deputy or Pro-Vice-Chancellor (International).
  * Typically an administrative Director of an International Office manages the strategic and procedural issues.
  * In some cases an autonomous unit is dedicated to international students and international recruitment can exist separate from the main university administration.
  * Some universities have off-shore administrative staff and/or marketing staff and/or offices aiding their activities in that country.

  
**Program delivery**|  Universities have begun to develop means of delivering their programs that increase access for international students such as:  


  * flexible web-based delivery (including distance education),
  * off-shore campuses, off-shore twinning arrangements,
  * off-shore partners that deliver all or part of their course(s).

  
In some cases, regional Australian universities have established metropolitan campuses due to the attraction of the larger cities to international students rather than less popular rural and smaller town environments.
