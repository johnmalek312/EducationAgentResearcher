There are 41 Australian universities, of which 3 are private (Bond, Torrens and Notre Dame). In addition, [Carnegie Mellon](http://www.australia.cmu.edu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/international/australia) have campuses in Adelaide, South Australia. As the main campuses and administrations of these university are established in Pennsylvania, USA and London, UK respectively; we consider them as non-Australian universities. 

Many Australian universities have overseas branch campuses, twinning arrangements and exchange programs for students and teaching staff worldwide. Australian universities have around 7,000 agreements with universities (and similar institutions around the world).

Australian Universities have three primary roles:

  * **Storing** knowledge
  * **Transferring** knowledge to others and
  * **Creating** knowledge.

In addition to this, Australian Universities provide consultancy services to business and industry and are a source of advice for Government and the community in general on a large number of issues and topics. They are closely involved with their local and wider communities.

Diversity and autonomy are central features of Australian universities. Each institution has the freedom to specify its own mission and purpose, modes of teaching and research, the make up of their student body and the range and content of their educational programs. This variety is reflected in the range of goals and objectives, staff profiles and the emphasis placed on particular courses at different universities.

**As an agent, you need to be aware of the particular goals of the universities that you promote.**

Higher education in Australia enjoys a strong international reputation. Australian universities are part of a clearly recognised international community of scholarship, with academic staff recruited internationally and students increasingly coming from overseas as well as from across Australia. At the same time, there are increasing numbers of Australian students and staff on study and work exchanges overseas.
