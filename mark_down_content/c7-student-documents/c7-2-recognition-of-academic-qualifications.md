With the introduction of the Internet and the increasing number of education providers throughout the world, there has been a significant rise in the range of providers of educational credentials. Unfortunately, many providers exist solely to generate profit (this means they ‘sell’ qualifications for little academic work); they are usually called “diploma mills”. At the same time there are sincere, but unaccredited institutions, whose quality of education is difficult to determine.

There are no set guidelines on how a qualification should be seen as ‘acceptable’. Australian institutions are free to determine the kinds of students for their courses. So, one qualification may be acceptable for one institution, but it may be unacceptable for another.

There is a range of resources available to make it easier to determine the acceptability of a qualification. It can be useful to use the [Generally Accepted Accrediting Principles (GAAP) Framework](http://www.b-ac.info/gaap-accreditation.html#:~:text=Generally%20accepted%20accrediting%20principles%20\(GAAP\)%20refer%20to%20a%20common%20set,centres%20and%20their%20education%20institutions.) to determine the acceptability of qualifications offered by an institution.

If an institution falls within the following guidelines, then probably an Australian education provider will accept this qualification:

**Category**| **Requirement**  
---|---  
Institutions in Australia| Listed on the Australian Qualifications Framework Register ([AQF](http://www.aqf.edu.au/RegisterAccreditation/AQFRegister/tabid/174/Default.aspx)).  
Institutions in the United States of America| Accredited by an agency recognised by either the [US Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) or the [Council for Higher Education Accreditation](http://www.chea.org/).  
Institutions in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth| Membership in the Association of Commonwealth Universities ([ACU](http://www.acu.ac.uk/)) and listed in the [Commonwealth Universities Yearbook](https://www.worldcat.org/title/3688319).  
Rest of the world| Accreditation and recognition through [AACRAO](https://www.aacrao.org/) and [NACES](https://www.naces.org/) with the participation of the College Board;  
OR  
-A listing in the Country Education Profiles, published by the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition and the Australian Education International ([NOOSR](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/services-and-resources/Pages/qualifications-recognition.aspx) – AEI).  
  
The most commonly used guide of whether an institution accepts a qualification in Australia is the Country Education Profiles produced by [NOOSR – AEI.](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/services-and-resources/Pages/qualifications-recognition.aspx)

Another similar online system is maintained by [UK NARIC](http://www.naric.org.uk/). This system compares the level of a particular qualification with the UK education system and is often used by educational institutions to assess qualifications from countries that are not described by the NOOSR – AEI Country Education Profiles. Both of these systems require a subscription fee.

### Professional recognition of qualifications

Professional associations vary in their approaches and types of qualifications they will accept for registration. Note that anybody can create an ‘association’ so it is important to check its credibility and status.

Most authoritative professional bodies require qualifications to be undertaken at particular educational institutions, and prescribe the required coursework. Senior members of the professional association generally sit on the internal accreditation panels to ensure that courses meet its requirements. The range of organisations involved in professional education is large and covers:

  * formal registration bodies
  * external accreditation bodies
  * voluntary professional associations
  * trade unions with professional interests
  * employer groups
  * state and national peak bodies.



Within Australia, the following professions have professional bodies, which mandate a Bachelor Degree (or equivalent) as an educational qualification for membership and the right to practise in the field:

Accountancy| Engineering| Nursing| Social Work  
---|---|---|---  
Architecture| Law| Physiotherapy| Teaching  
Computing| Medicine| Psychology| Veterinary Science
