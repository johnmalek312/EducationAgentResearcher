It’s possible to access both government and non-government sources of data. However, you need to be careful when analysing data from different sources to ensure that like comparisons are made.

For example, data for Foundation Year students is not separated from Higher Education statistics and may also be reported within VET or Other Sector enrolments. Also, a Foundation Year student may have enrolled in an ELICOS course prior to commencing the Foundation Year program within the reporting period. This means that this student is counted as two enrolments – one in the ELICOS data and one in the Higher Education data.

### Government sources of data

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  
---  
Austrade  
– [Student Enrolment Statistics](http://www.austrade.gov.au/Export/Export-Markets/Industries/Education/International-Student-Data/default.aspx)| – Austrade student enrolment data is derived from the PRISMS database and counts enrolments by students who require a student visa to enter Australia.  
– Data includes commencements, finishes and year to date counts. It is broken down by nationality, sector, state/territory, field of study and level of study.  
  
Note that Austrade reports on enrolments as evidenced by eCoEs. For example, a student may have an eCoE for a Bachelor of Economics course and an eCoE for an ELICOS course at the same time – this counts as two enrolments.  
Austrade offshore network  
– [Offshore support](https://www.austrade.gov.au/)| – Located in many countries, Austrade offices provide training programs for local agents interested in increasing their knowledge about Australian institutions and market intelligence updates.

[IDP – International Education Statistics](http://www.idp.com/idp-today/research-services/industry-statistics.aspx)| – IDP conducts a ‘head count’ of international higher education students enrolled in Australian institutions on March 31. The results of IDP surveys are released bi-annually around July and November.  
– The data is useful for information on international students by mode of study (onshore and offshore) and trends in offshore enrolments (transnational campus and distance education courses).
