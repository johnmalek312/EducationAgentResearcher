### Participants

  * You – a counsellor working in an offshore agency
  * A 22-year-old student currently studying at a university in Australia



### Situation

  * The student’s laptop was stolen from the classroom in Australia.
  * The student contacted you asking for your advice.
  * She has not told anyone else because she is afraid that her student visa will be cancelled if she’s involved in a crime.



### Considerations

  * What are the legal rights of an overseas student in this case?
  * What are the implications for her student visa?
  * Who could assist the student a) at the education provider? b) outside of the institute?
