### Participants

  * You – a counsellor working in an agency
  * A student
  * The student’s friend



### Situation

  * A student is thinking about undertaking a Diploma of Business program at a TAFE College and then a Bachelor of Business at an affiliated university. You have an agency agreement with these institutions.
  * His friend says that the foundation program she is studying in will be better for him as it guarantees entry if he gets the required grades.
  * The foundation program is run by a private college that you do not have a recruitment agreement with.
  * The student wants your opinion.



### Considerations

  * You would prefer to place the student in an institution that you represent and claim commission from.
  * You want to find points of comparison between the two courses that presents the Diploma route in a favourable manner.
  * You want to tell the student the truth.
