Australia ensures that international students receive the highest quality of English language instruction. Australia is the only country in the world to have mandatory national standards specific to English language training and international students. The quality of courses and institutions providing English training are supported by two recognised industry associations:

  * National ELT Accreditation Scheme Limited ([NEAS](https://neas.org.au/)).
  * English Australia ([EA](http://www.englishaustralia.com.au/)).



### English Australia (EA)

EA is the national professional association of ELICOS colleges, and currently it has over 120 member centres.

EA also plays an important role in maintaining quality in the ELICOS sector. Its member colleges are required to:

  * abide by by-laws which provide a Code of Conduct
  * participate in a Tuition Assurance Scheme
  * participate in Membership Quality Assurance and
  * abide by the minimum requirements of the EA refund and transfer policies.



EA membership provides additional assurances of high quality and fair dealing in both public and private English language colleges.

### National ELT Accreditation Scheme Limited (NEAS)

NEAS endorses English language centres in universities, colleges and high schools. Endorsed centres are granted the NEAS quality mark, internationally recognised and valued by students, teachers, agents and governments.
