The **English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS)** sector is an important one within the Australian Education system.

English language training commonly takes place in dedicated colleges or centres. These centres are completely focused on the needs of international students, so they have highly developed support services for such students. 

English language training is often the first type of course an international student may undertake in Australia so ELICOS colleges have well-developed reception, orientation and accommodation placement processes to reflect this fact.

ELICOS students typically come on a student visa, a tourist visa or a working holiday visa. People on a tourist visa are only permitted to study for a maximum of three months and those on working holiday visas for a maximum of four months. Individuals wishing to study in Australia for longer than this should apply for a student visa.

Those ELICOS students who hold a student visa are covered by the ESOS Act (see B3). However students on tourist visas, working holiday or other visas are not covered by the ESOS Act.

ELICOS courses can be taken by students as stand-alone courses. In this case a student may wish to improve their English proficiency and then return to their home country. According to previous trends, around 40% of students use the language course as the first in a pathway of courses leading to formal qualifications in the other sectors.

### Types of ELICOS centres

There are approximately 250 accredited ELICOS centres across Australia, and many different types, including:

  * those located in all of Australiaâ€™s major cities as well as in a range of regional locations
  * those which are private or government operated
  * those which are independent or attached to a high school, TAFE college or university
  * small boutique colleges or large international providers.
