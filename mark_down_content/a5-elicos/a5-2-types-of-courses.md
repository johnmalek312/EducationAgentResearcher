ELICOS providers and courses need to follow a careful quality assurance process. This specifies the minimum qualifications of teachers, class sizes, types of facilities, and the number of study hours per week.

ELICOS courses are accredited by either [TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/) or [ASQA](http://www.asqa.gov.au/) as non-award courses outside of the AQF. However, a small number of courses are accredited as VET courses on the AQF. The nature of the accreditation body should not influence the quality of the educational experience for the student.

Australia offers a wide range of ELICOS courses designed to meet the varying needs of students with different reasons for learning English. Full-time ELICOS courses tend to have these features:

  * Their duration generally ranges from 4 to 48 weeks,
  * They are taught at all levels of proficiency from beginners to advanced.
  * They comprise of at least 20 hours of study each week.
  * They usually have flexible commencement dates, so students can enrol at any time during the year.



Often ELICOS courses are taken in sequence with formal courses of study in other sectors. They are packaged together with one or more courses. Sometimes these further courses are offered at the same institution.

There are five major categories of English language courses generally offered in Australia to international students:

  1. General English
  2. English for Academic Purposes (EAP)
  3. Secondary School Preparation
  4. Examination Preparation
  5. English for Specific Purposes (ESP)



In addition, some ELICOS centres have developed and deliver specific courses to suit the needs of particular clients; for example, courses that may concentrate on executive English, corporate ELICOS training or Study Tour Programs (these programs usually combine English language study with other activities e.g. travelling or sporting activities).

### 1\. General English

These courses help improve English skills in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students can enter at any level, from elementary to advanced, and they progress at their own pace.

Students are generally tested and placed in an appropriate class level at the start of their studies. Classes at each level focus on everyday English, and often include a variety of activities.

General English is suitable for individuals or for holiday groups and as preparation for the English for Academic Purposes courses.

### 2\. English for Academic Purposes (EAP)

EAP courses are designed to help students succeed in university studies by improving their English and academic study skills. They help students achieve the level of English language proficiency needed to undertake tertiary studies at Australian and International universities (usually around IELTS 6.0 to 6.5 or TOEFL Paper 530 to 570 or other equivalent language tests). A large percentage of students who complete the courses enrol in Australian universities.

EAP programs are generally offered as full-time courses of approximately 10 weeks for each module. EAP courses generally start and finish at dates which match with the university’s academic semesters. This allows students to move easily into formal degree courses.

### 3\. Secondary School Preparation

These programs are generally designed to:

  * develop speaking, listening, reading and writing skills
  * inform students about the education system in Australia
  * familiarise students with teaching methodologies they will encounter in their secondary studies and
  * introduce specific subject areas and assist with subject selection.



### 4\. Examination Preparation

While not offering formal qualifications, many English courses focus on preparing students for external English proficiency examinations such as:

  * [Cambridge exams](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/why-choose-us/study-abroad/australia/) (PET, FCE, CAE, CPE, & BEC), which are the most popular,
  * [the IELTS exam](http://www.ielts.org/),
  * [the TOEFL exam](http://www.ets.org/toefl),
  * [the TOEIC test](http://www.ets.org/toeic).



These courses are generally provided for students aged 17 and above and involve intensive test practice. They cater to people who wish to:

  * enter educational institutions
  * work in English-speaking countries and
  * obtain a qualification that is valued by employers in their home country.



### 5\. English for Specific Purposes

These courses are generally specialised to meet a specific student need for technical English proficiency. They are often designed specifically for a small student group with similar needs. Courses that are less than 13 weeks in length are often taken while on a tourist visa.

This category also includes “Business English” courses that are designed for adults seeking job specific English language training. Generally the courses are intensive and focus on improving students’ use of English in the workplace. Most programs expect students to arrive with strong general English skills, and generally start at intermediate and move through advanced levels.

### 6\. Short Courses for non-student visa holders

Students may obtain a tourist visa to study English for less than 3 months , or if on a working holiday visa, study a maximum of 4 months. These students may undertake the same programs and classes as student visa holders. Note that students studying for less than four months can still apply for a student visa if they wish to.

If the students come as a group, then they can have a specific program tailored for them. This is usually known as a ‘study tour’.

Study tours usually have these features:

  * They are designed for students studying in their own country either in High School or in Higher Education and take place during holiday periods.
  * They combine tourist or specialised activities with English study.
  * They are often structured around a particular group of students coming from one source overseas (a school, university or workplace).



Study Tours are not covered by the ESOS Act nor the National Code. This means that they do not need to meet any specified requirements in terms of hours of study, teacher qualifications or facilities.

English Colleges that are members of [English Australia](http://www.englishaustralia.com.au/) must conform to best practice guidelines when offering study tours. English Australia can also protect non-student visa holders in the event that if a college closes, affected students are placed in another program. 

**Agents need to ensure that students who select a study tour are clear about the expectations of the program of study.**

Study tours can provide all types of Business and English language packages. Often these tours can be coupled with business conventions and conferences. However, affordable tours can cater to all groups, from school students and tourists to special interest technical groups wishing to further their studies in their specific area of interest.

Many different types of special interest tours and holiday group travel tours are available. Some examples include:

  * Agriculture
  * Mining and smelting
  * Eco-tourism and Environmental Projects
  * Back-packing group tours with adventures & English lessons
  * Aged care, Nursing and Dietician studies
  * Living English with practical experiences
  * High School & Junior High School holiday tours
  * Specialised technical and information tours
  * Trade missions, Government and VIP tours
  * Overseas incentive tours and conventions
  * University, Holiday & Graduation tours and conventions



No formal qualifications are awarded at the completion of these kinds of courses.
