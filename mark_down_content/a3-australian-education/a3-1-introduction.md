### What is the Australian Education System?

**Schools**

Each state government manages the school system within their state and provides funding for their schools. Both public schools and private schools exist in each state. The curriculum taught in each state or school may vary but the learning areas are the same in all.

You can find out more about each State and Territory’s education system by viewing their web sites below:

**Vocational Education and Training**

Australia has a Vocational Education and Training (VET) system. VET prepares people for work in a career that does not need a university degree. the national body [ASQA](http://www.asqa.gov.au/) regulates and manages the system and ensures consistent national standards. Typically, a VET course takes up to two years of study.

In the workplace, employers use agreed courses and outcomes to set standards of training for employment. Many parts of industry and business provide ongoing workplace training for their employees. Some of this training can count towards a qualification. People who are educated overseas can gain recognition of their training which may help them to get employment.

**Higher Education**

The national government provides the funding for universities in all the states. While each university is independent in its governance and can decide on which courses they want to offer and the course content, they are regulated by [TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/). Typically, a university course takes three or four years of study.

### Participation of Australians in education

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes information about the participation of Australia residents in education. Participation in education beyond compulsory schooling is encouraged.

For the nation, having a skilled work force is vital in supporting ongoing economic development and improving living conditions.,

In 2020-21, 42% of Australians aged 15-74 years had participated in learning over the past 12 months (7.8 million people). You can access specific data about participation in education [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/education/work-related-training-and-adult-learning-australia/2020-21). 

It is compulsory for all Australian students to attend school until Year 10 or age 16.
