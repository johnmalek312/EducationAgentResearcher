The Australian Qualifications Framework ([AQF](http://www.aqf.edu.au/)) is a system of seventeen national qualifications in 3 sectors:

  * Schools,
  * Vocational Education and Training (TAFE and private providers),
  * Higher Education (mainly universities).



The qualifications shown below are grouped according to the educational sector in which they are most commonly issued.

A qualification normally offered in one sector may be provided by an institution in a different sector. For example:

  * schools may offer a Certificate III course within their senior school,
  * a University may offer a Diploma,
  * some Vocational Colleges may offer Bachelor Degrees.



### Are all Australian education courses listed on the AQF?

Some courses are not recorded on the AQF even though they offer excellent education and outcomes. For example:

  * many English language courses (ELICOS),
  * some foundation studies,
  * non-award programs.



These courses do not award a formal qualification as listed on the AQF table above.

### Why is the AQF important?

The AQF is important since it:

  * provides a clear structure for the level of each qualification,
  * allows students to build their qualifications from lower to higher levels,
  * allows one education institution to clearly understand the level of a qualification awarded by another and provide appropriate credit.
  * determines the student visa subclass that a student receives when they study in Australia (see B7).
