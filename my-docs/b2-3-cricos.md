The ESOS Act also provides for a register of all educational institutions and courses that are offered to international students in Australia. This register is called the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students [(](http://cricos.deewr.gov.au/)[CRICOS](http://cricos.education.gov.au/)[)](http://cricos.deewr.gov.au/).

Each institution and course is provided with a unique identifying number. These numbers are listed on CRICOS, which is an online database and is available to everybody. The ESOS Act specifies the information that CRICOS must record.

If an institution or course is not registered on CRICOS, it is NOT possible to apply for a student visa to study in Australia in that institution or course.

As an Agent you are forbidden to make an offer to a student who seeks to obtain a student visa to apply for a course that is not registered on CRICOS.
