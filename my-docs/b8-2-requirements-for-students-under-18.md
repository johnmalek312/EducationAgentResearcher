Under Australian law, an individual under 18 is not yet an adult. So certain requirements apply to these students. The student must provide evidence of adequate welfare arrangements for the duration of their visa, or until they turn 18, to make a valid visa application. 

The student must show they have adequate welfare arrangements in one of the following ways:

  * live in Australia with a parent or legal custodian (applicant must complete Form 157N to nominate a Student Guardian).
  * live in Australia with a relative who is a Student Guardian visa (subclass 590) holder (guardian must apply for this visa and complete Form 157N) or holding other valid visa in Australia. The relative must be over 21 years of age with good character and be nominated by the parents or custodians.
  * the student’s education provider will provide for their general welfare and accommodation (provider will issue a Confirmation of Adequate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW) letter.
  * A secondary exchange student must provide their AASES form. 



If the student will be living with a relative (but not the parent), the nominated relative must:

  * be a brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, step-grandparent, step-aunt, step-uncle, step-niece or step-nephew
  * be aged over 21 years
  * have the right to remain in Australia until the visa expires or the student turns 18 years-of-age (whichever happens first)
  * and have a police clearance check.



The student’s parents or custodian need to prove that the nominated relative meets these criteria.

The student’s parent or custodian must complete Form 1229 – Consent to grant an Australian visa to a child under the age of 18 years.

#### Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW)

If a younger student is not living with a parent or suitable relative, the education provider must sign a Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW) letter approving the student’s general welfare and accommodation arrangements before the student visa can be issued. The provider must nominate two dates:

  1. when the provider has elected to begin taking responsibility for the student’s welfare, and
  2. when the provider will cease to take responsibility for approving the welfare arrangements for that student.



If a student’s welfare arrangements are approved by education provider students must not travel to Australia until the welfare arrangements are due to commence. Dates are nominated by the provider not the student.
