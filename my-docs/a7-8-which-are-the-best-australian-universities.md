International Students often want to know which the ‘best’ universities in Australia are. In many countries, universities are officially ranked on a scale. However, the judgments that underlie this kind of ‘ranking’ can be too subjective and the rank may not necessarily match what is best for a particular student’s individual needs.

One commonly referred to international ranking table is the [Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2022) from the Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The ARWU has been published by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy since 2009. A range of other ranking methods are summarised by the [Australian Education Network](http://www.australian-universities.com/rankings/).

It is also rare to find a university anywhere in the world that is the ‘best’ in all that they do. Likewise, a reputation earned in one discipline, perhaps many years ago, may not be relevant to another discipline in the 21st Century.

However, there are a number of possible indicators that show the relative standings of Australian universities.

### Entry Standards

While entry levels are fairly uniform for entry into Australian university degrees, different universities do have different requirements for entry into similar courses. The relative academic levels can illustrate which universities are considered better. This can show how, in general, academically more able students choose one university over another to do a similar course.

### Groups of Universities

Universities that share common characteristics have formed groups and networks that to some extent illustrate differences in focus and objectives between groups of universities and the commonalities of those within the group. These groups may be linked through a formal network, such as the [Australian Technology Network](http://www.atn.edu.au/) of Universities (ATN) and the [Regional Universities Network ](http://www.run.edu.au/)which have their headquarters situated in a regional centre. All Australian universities are members of [Universities Australia](http://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/), the peak body representing the university sector:
