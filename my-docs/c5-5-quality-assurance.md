International students in Australia and their parents enjoy a very high level of service and financial protection. Quality is assured in a number of ways:

### Registration

Institutions must be registered with the Australian Government and meet special registration conditions enabling them to deliver courses to international students in Australia.

### Standards

Both public and private institutions must meet high standards of quality and ethical practice, which take into account such issues as:

  * curriculum
  * qualifications of teaching staff and
  * facilities including specialist equipment.



### Processes

Quality assurance processes in education and training in Australia are strengthened by:

  * The Australian Quality Training Framework ([AQTF](https://www.aqf.edu.au/));
  * The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency ([TEQSA](http://www.teqsa.gov.au/));
  * The Australian Skills Quality Agency ([ASQA](https://www.asqa.gov.au/))
  * The Tuition Protection Service ([TPS](https://tps.gov.au/Home/NotLoggedIn))



Australian Government quality assurance measures can only extend to students in Australia and those enrolled in a registered institution and course. However, if an institution offers courses at an offshore campus or through an agent, the institution will be expected to maintain standards at least equivalent to those provided in Australia and carry full responsibility for all aspects of delivery.
