An education agent who acts professionally gives student applicants accurate and current information that is from trusted sources, such as government websites, and up-to-date advice from education providers. It is better for your business and Australia’s education sector if a well-prepared individual decides to study in Australia.

The [ESOS Act](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00757) describes how the education provider must behave in relation to the recruitment of overseas students, including publishing a list of all its agents.

An Education Institution must not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct in connection with:

  1. the recruitment of overseas students or intending overseas students; or
  2. the provision of courses to overseas students.



It also describes the connection between the ESOS Act and the [National Code](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01182/Html/Text#_Toc487026935) in**** Part A, and (or) Standard 4 of the National Code.

Education providers must take all reasonable measures to use education agents that have an appropriate knowledge and understanding of the Australian international education industry and do not use education agents who are dishonest or lack integrity.

The education provider must have a written agreement with education agents it engages to formally represent it. ‘Formally’ covers situations where the agent promotes courses of the education provider with the intention of recruiting students for the provider.

Providers are not required to have a written agreement with agents who act informally on behalf of a single student or their parents.

However, an education provider must not accept students from an agent who is, or has been, engaged in dishonest recruitment practices.

  * The written agreement must specify the responsibilities of the education agent and the education provider and the need to abide by the National Code 2018.
  * The education provider ensures its education agents have up-to-date and accurate marketing information.
