There are some important points about courses that you need to be aware of:

  * Courses can vary considerably in form, entry requirements, duration and method of assessment.
  * The academic year is generally from early March to late November, or mid-July to late June of the following year.
  * The year is normally divided into two semesters, although some universities offer three semesters in one calendar year for certain courses.
  * Students studying towards a Doctoral Degree or other postgraduate research awards may be able to negotiate an alternative starting date with their research supervisor.



The following qualifications are available at Australian universities and approved higher education providers. This information is general, so it’s important to understand that a particular university course may not have exactly the same length or purpose.

All of these qualifications are listed on the [AQF](https://www.aqf.edu.au/framework/aqf-qualifications).

**COURSE**| **NOTES**  
---|---  
Diploma  
Duration = 1 – 2 years| 

  * This is offered by some universities and university colleges.
  * It is the same level as a Diploma that is offered by a VET institution.

  
**UNDERGRADUATE**  
Bachelor Degree  
Duration = minimum of 3 years| 

  * This is the basic university qualification and is required for entry to a profession.
  * Study involves acquiring a systematic and coherent body of knowledge, its underlying principles and concepts and associated problem-solving techniques.
  * Students develop the academic skills and aptitudes to comprehend and evaluate new information, concepts and evidence from a wide range of sources. Also, students learn to review, consolidate, extend and apply the knowledge and techniques that they have learned. 
  * Study usually involves major studies in an area where significant academic literature is available.
  * Course content is to a significant depth and progressively developed to a high level. This also prepares students for further postgraduate study if desired.

  
Bachelor Degree (Honours)  
Duration = 4 years| 

  * A Bachelor Degree with Honours takes an additional year after a Bachelor Degree with a focus on research.
  * Honours may also be granted where outstanding achievement is recorded in a Bachelor Degree course of four or more years.

  
**POSTGRADUATE**  
Graduate Certificate  
Duration = 6 months| 

  * The Graduate Certificate typically involves broadening individual skills already gained in an undergraduate program, or developing vocational knowledge and skills in a new professional area.

  
Graduate Diploma  
Duration = 12 months| 

  * The Graduate Diploma either broadens individual skills obtained in an undergraduate program or develops vocational knowledge and skills in a new professional area.
  * This qualification involves further specialisation within a systematic and coherent body of knowledge.

  
Masters Degree (Coursework)  
Duration = 1 – 2 years| 

  * The Masters Degree enhances specific professional or vocational skills.
  * It is typically gained by coursework and some research.
  * Study involves acquiring an in-depth understanding of a specific area of knowledge usually by independent research.
  * A Masters Degree takes one to two years, after completion of a Bachelors Degree.

  
Masters Degree (Research) – MPhil  
Duration = 1 – 2 years| 

  * The Master of Philosophy program aims to provide research training that develops independent research skills including:
    * ability to formulate a significant problem;
    * mastery of appropriate conceptual and methodological frameworks;
    * capacity for articulate and critical analysis.
  * Admission requires a Bachelor degree with Honours but students may be admitted after completing a Graduate Diploma and having significant work experience.
  * It is possible to transfer to a PhD program after 1 year full-time if the work in the MPhil course is considered to be a suitable standard.

  
Doctoral Degree  
(Doctor of Philosophy – PhD)  
Duration = usually 3 years| 

  * The Doctoral Degree is the highest award offered by Australian universities. Although traditional PhDs are research degrees, some programs may have a coursework component.
  * There are three components to a Doctoral Degree: 
    * a review of relevant literature, experimentation, or other systemic approaches to a body of knowledge.
    * an original research project resulting in a significant contribution to knowledge and understanding and/or the application of knowledge within a discipline or field of study.
    * a substantial and well-ordered thesis, demonstrating the relationship of the research to the broader framework of the discipline or field of study.

  
  
### Non-University Higher Education

TAFE Institutes, specialised institutes and other private colleges also provide post-school qualifications. While they mostly offer courses to a Diploma level, some courses are offered through to Bachelor degree level.

Some of these institutions offer degrees in specialised areas that no universities cover. For example, the Australian Defence Force Academy ([ADFA](http://www.defence.gov.au/adfa/)) offers degrees in military subjects or the [Endeavour College of Natural Health](http://www.endeavour.edu.au/) offers degrees in alternative medicine.
