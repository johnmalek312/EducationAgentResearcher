Australian qualifications are recognised in and outside of Australia.

**Within Australia**

The Australian Qualifications Framework ([AQF](http://www.aqf.edu.au/)) covers most courses and training undertaken by international students in Australia. The AQF is a national system of learning pathways, which is endorsed by the Australian Government and recognised throughout Australia and by other countries.

On completing an AQF qualification, international students can progress to the next AQF level anywhere in Australia as long as they satisfy student visa requirements.

**Outside of Australia**

Australian qualifications are also internationally recognised when students seek employment or when they consider further study at leading international universities.
