There are many programs that are available to international students before, during and at the end of their study in Australia (this is required by the National Code).

### **Pre-departure**

Pre-departure briefings are arranged by some universities or are run by some agencies. Students generally are most interested in the pre-arrival and on-arrival information they receive at these briefings, so information should be focused on practical information relating to:

  * settling in
  * finding accommodation 
  * what to expect in a new country.



The following areas need to be considered in a pre-departure briefing:

**What students need to know before they leave their home country**|  Students should be encouraged to use a checklist that has information about:

  * The climate in the area they will be studying
  * The local environment, community, campus
  * What to pack
  * Preparing for a homestay experience
  * Preparing for independent living
  * Telephone and internet access
  * What the school, college, university can provide before arrival
  * What to expect in the classroom
  * Relationships
  * Emotional preparation
  * Safety and security
  * Who the student should contact with problems or for information
  * The documents that should be carried, read and understood
  * Airport reception and what to do if the pickup does not arrive.

**Possible questions from student and their families**|  Many parents attend pre-departure briefings with their students. Parents often have questions about safety, security and supervision of younger students.  
**Asking senior students to help with pre-departure**|  Students who have completed a year or two of their Australian studies (and who are home for vacation) can be useful in providing first-hand information to students who are preparing to study in Australia for the first time.  
**Preparing interactive online presentations and resources**|  Online and interactive presentations are worth considering if students are unable to attend briefings. Monash University, for example, has pre-departure information on their [website](http://www.monash.edu/study/international/prepare/australia.html).  
**What students need to know on arrival**|  Most education providers send detailed on-arrival information to students before they arrive. This may include:  


  * How to use public transport
  * Currency, banking, shopping
  * How to contact the school, college or university
  * Dates of enrolment, orientation, commencement.

  
  
### Orientation

Orientation programs are a regular part of the international student support process. Providers develop and deliver these in a range of formats according to the number of students, and the time of intake into courses.

Orientation programs for large universities are often published on the university’s website to inform students what is available to them. Other providers send orientation information with the CoE and most will have this information available upon request.

It is expected that all students attend orientation programs to:

  * Receive a formal welcome to the school, college or university
  * Receive vital information about the new study environment
  * Have course and enrolment information explained
  * Be informed about campus life and facilities such as banking and public transport
  * Have specialised staff available to discuss accommodation options and issues
  * Be informed about language and learning support
  * Be informed about visa compliance obligations
  * Meet new friends, teachers and international student advisers
  * Become familiar with the library resources and research facilities
  * Understand what is expected of them as an independent learner in Australia
  * Have campus tours
  * Enjoy a range of social activities.



### Mentoring

Many new international students will be offered the opportunity to join a peer mentoring, or peer support program. These programs may be run by academic faculties or the international office and can include:

  * Social activities run by senior students for newly arrived international students
  * Activities to familiarise new students with their local area, and accommodation options
  * Campus tours
  * Learning support groups
  * Emotional support.



Here is an example of the [orientation program](http://www.uq.edu.au/orientation/) at the University of Queensland.

### Returning home program

It is recommended that international students participate in a returning home program, especially if they are studying at university. These programs are an opportunity for students completing their studies to:

  * Gather together and discuss their student experience
  * Collect information about leaving Australia, settling accounts, accommodation, and arranging freight transfer for possessions
  * Be acknowledged formally by the university on their achievements
  * understand the experience of returning home and ‘reverse culture-shock’
  * Say goodbye to classmates and teachers.



Some universities hire academic caps and gowns so students can have official photographs taken. This is because many students leave Australia before their graduation ceremony or a ceremony is not held in their home country.

Postgraduate students are connected through their university campuses to the Council of Postgraduate Associations ([CAPA](http://www.capa.edu.au/)), which was formed in 1979 to represent the rights and interests of postgraduate students. CAPA provides a national forum to discuss common issues for international postgraduates.

### Spouse and partners programs

Many universities have developed programs and activities for the partners of students, particularly postgraduates. Partners and children of students often need support and they are often isolated if they are not working or connected to their local communities. These programs aim to provide informal networks for these individuals.

While pastoral care is part of the educational provider’s obligations and student support is of a very high standard, students should realise that they are also responsible for finding out where support and information is available. It is expected that students will ask questions and seek information (and all services and support offices encourage this).
