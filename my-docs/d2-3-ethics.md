Being ethical means that agents knowingly choose a correct action rather than an incorrect one.

In a commercial environment, there can be a temptation to ‘cut corners’ or to undertake an activity that the agent knows is ethically wrong but which gives a commercial advantage.

**The London Statement**

Standard 4.3.4 of the National Code 2018 states that education **agents must have have appropriate knowledge and understanding Australian International Education and Training Agent Code of Ethics**. It is based on the London Statement, a 2012 landmark statement by the UK, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand on a best practice approach to ethical recruitment by education agencies.

The Code of Ethics can be found [here](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/News/Latest-News/Documents/Australian%20International%20Education%20and%20Training%20-%20Agent%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf). The Ethical framework includes guidance on the following:

  * **Integrity** – being straightforward and honest in all professional and business dealings
  * **Objectivity** – not allowing professional judgment to be compromised by bias or conflict of interest
  * **Professional competence and due care** – maintaining professional knowledge and professional service, and acting diligently
  * **Transparency** – declaring conflicts of interest to all clients, especially when service fees are charged to both the education provider and the prospective student
  * **Confidentiality** – respecting and preserving the confidentiality of personal information acquired and not releasing such information to third parties without proper authority
  * **Professional behaviour** – acting in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and dealing with clients competently, diligently and fairly and
  * **Professionalism and purpose** – acting in a manner that will serve the interests of clients and the wider society even at the expense of self-interest; recognising that dedication to these principles is the means by which the profession can earn the trust and confidence of stakeholder groups (individual clients, the public, business and government).



The seven principles of the Code of Ethics are below.

  1. Agents and consultants practice responsible business ethics.
  2. Agents and consultants provide current, accurate and honest information in an ethical manner.
  3. Agents and consultants develop transparent business relationships with students and providers through the use of written agreements.
  4. Agents and consultants protect the interests of minors.
  5. Agents and consultants provide current and up-to-date information that enables international students to make informed choices when selecting which agent or consultant to employ.
  6. Agents and consultants act professionally.
  7. Agents and consultants work with destination countries and providers to raise ethical standards and best practice.



An ethical agent demonstrates this understanding in their work.

### Unethical Practice in Dealings with Students

**Examples:**| **Explanation**  
---|---  
Charging ‘hidden’ fees| Some agents have charged students fees for their services progressively without informing them from the beginning. For example, once a student’s application has been sent to providers, they begin to introduce new charges for student visa applications, or medical checks. This is unethical behaviour.  
Misrepresenting fee structures| A number of agents have misrepresented the fee structure of some providers’ courses. For example, a student normally pays OHSC on enrolment. There have been reports of agents not informing student’s that OHSC has been included in the fee and keeping this portion of money. Just before the student applies for their student visa, they learn from their agent that their OHSC has not been paid and are asked to pay this money again.  
Placement into a course for commission reasons alone without due regard of a students needs| An agency may have a limited number of providers that it recruits for and can claim commission. So, there is a temptation to persuade students to go to one of these providers against the educational interests of the student.  
Not protecting students personal details| In the normal course of their role, agents learn a great deal of personal information about their students. It is important that they:

  * treat this information confidentially and carefully
  * do not pass this on to other businesses or people without the permission of the student.

  
  
### Unethical Practice in Dealings with providers

**Examples:**| **Explanation**  
---|---  
Submitting fraudulent documents| In some cases agents have knowingly submitted false documents to providers and sometimes they have been involved in creating the false documentation.  
  
While many academic documents can be verified (such as language test results), other documents can be more difficult to identify such as work-related testimonials.  
Deceptive advertising| It is important that advertising does not mislead students, even though it will seek to inform students of the benefits of studying at a particular provider or course.  
  
A course outcome can be misleading if false claims are made about:  


  * likely employment on successful completion
  * a provider’s facilities
  * the local environment.

  
Unfair comparisons| Similar to deceptive advertising, false comparisons can be drawn between courses or providers to make a course or provider appear more or less appealing. For example, the name of a provider may be similar to a prestigious university and suggestions that the two are linked may unfairly promote the first provider.  
Hidden sub-agent networks| Many agents form business relationships with other agencies, especially to form co-operative arrangements that allow them to cover a larger geographical area or represent more institutions. However, the ESOS Act makes providers responsible for their agent’s activities and the provider should always approve where their marketing material is circulated and who is counselling students on their behalf. Sub-agencies are not a problem if providers are fully informed of the arrangements.  
  
Some sub-agent networks are hidden from providers, which believe that one agent alone is recruiting from a particular region when in fact a number of agencies are recruiting on their behalf but only one agent submits the documents. This practice puts the providers at risk under Australian law.  
  
### Unethical Practice in Dealings with the education industry

**Examples:**| **Explanation**  
---|---  
Obtaining student visas for individuals who do not intend to study| Agents need to ensure that individuals come to Australia for the purpose of study.  
Not adhering to the legislation surrounding visa advice| For agencies in Australia, the laws governing visa advice require individuals to be Registered Migration Agents to provide substantive visa advice. There is a fine line between providing general study advice and student visa information, so agencies may be tempted to provide this information unlawfully.  
  
This does not apply to agencies operating outside of Australia.  
Being engaged in fraudulent practices| Some agents have arranged for other students to sit for the English language tests on behalf of a student who is weak in English.  
  
Some agents have acted dishonestly by preparing inauthentic documents for their student clients.  
‘Poaching’ students from other agents and institutions| It is natural that sometimes students wish to change from using one agent to another. For example, they may not want to apply to an institution that the first agent does not represent. However, some agencies engage in systematic ‘poaching’. This means that once a student has gained a substantial amount of information from one agent, another agent approaches them and offers some form of inducement (eg. a fee discount) so the student changes to apply through the second agent. The original agent gets no commission for their initial work. Similarly, some agents induce students to change institutions in the same way without regard for educational suitability or outcomes.  
  
These practices are harmful as they set agencies and institutions against one another and promote the idea that recruitment alone is the only important aspect of an agent’s role. This neglects the need to provide an on-going support system to the student.
