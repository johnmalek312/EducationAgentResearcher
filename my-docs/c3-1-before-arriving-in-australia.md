At this stage the management of the student involves:

  * Recruitment
  * Application and Letter of Offer
  * Payment and Confirmation of Enrolment
  * Student Visa Application and Grant
  * Pre-Departure Briefing



**As an agent, you are required to create (and update) a student file to keep copies of all relevant documents and correspondence regarding the management of your student (this can be in a paper or electronic format).**

### Recruitment

The recruitment of students is the first step in the client management process.

Recruitment can take many forms and is usually managed in collaboration with a client institution. Some examples are shown below:

**TYPE OF RECRUITMENT**| **FEATURES**  
---|---  
Exhibitions| The institution is represented and applications are processed through an agency. If the institution is present, application fees are usually ‘waived’ (that is, the application fee does not need to be paid).  
Interviews| A representative from the institution holds interview sessions at an agent’s office. Application fees are often waived in this situation.  
Walk-In| A student visits your agency through either an advertising campaign or word of mouth referral.  
Links / Alliances| Sometimes an overseas institution has an agreement (eg. articulation, twinning or study abroad) with an Australian or overseas institution. In this situation a particular agency may be promoted as the preferred application route.  
  
During this stage of the process a student is advised on their different study options including institutions, programs, costs and locations.

### Application and Letter of Offer

After understanding their study options, the student needs to submit an application form.

The required documents for an international student’s application usually include:

  * Certified copies of their**academic history** to date, including high school results, university results and awards;
  * Certified copies of their **English Language proficiency** (eg. IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic, CAE or evidence that their medium of instruction has been English);
  * Certified copies of **ID** (e.g. passport)
  * For research study, a copy of their research proposal may also be required.



You need to decide how many applications to send and to which institutions. This is a judgement for an agency to make as policy. It might be preferable to send a small number of applications as best practice because:

  * For the student this will provide a choice of programs at different institutions.
  * For the institutions, it is likely they will be more supportive of you if they receive a small number of applications that convert to enrolments rather than receiving and processing a large number of applications with few conversions.



The institution will reply to a student’s application in one of four ways:

**REPLY TO APPLICATION**| **DETAILS**  
---|---  
A Rejection letter| This indicates the student does not meet entry requirements for that program at that specific institution.  
A Conditional Offer letter| This is a request for additional information. For example, the offer may be conditional on the student providing certified copies of their documents or conditional on undertaking further English language training. You would need to contact the student to supply the additional information required. Once the conditions are fulfilled, the student would receive a Full Offer letter.  
A Full Offer letter| This indicates a student is eligible for direct entry into that institution’s program.  
A Package Offer letter  
(a version of a Full Offer letter)| This is a full offer to a program with an additional conditional offer into another program. For example, a Foundation Package Offer is a Full Offer into a Foundation Program plus a conditional offer into an undergraduate program. The letter would explain that if a student successfully fulfilled certain conditions during their Foundation Program, they would then be given direct entry into a degree program.  
  
### Payment and Confirmation of Enrolment

A Full Offer (or Package Offer) letter is often accompanied by a letter of acceptance. If the student wishes to accept the offer, they need to sign this document and then you would return it with a copy of the payment (e.g. copy of international bank transfer or credit card authorisation form) to the institution.

The payment required usually consists of:

  * tuition fees for the program (usually the first semester);
  * Overseas Student Health Cover (single or family).



Once payment is confirmed a student is issued with an electronic Confirmation of Enrolment Form.

In most cases the institution would issue this and then forward it, via the agent, to the student.  
In some cases the institution may have authorised an agent to create CoEs on their behalf. This CoE is then being checked by the institution staff and if found correct, authorised by them. The agent then prints out the authorised CoE.

With a valid CoE all students at all Assessment levels can apply for a Student visa at their local Australian High Commission or Australian Embassy. 

### Student Visa Application and Grant

Once the student has a CoE, an application for a student visa needs to be processed. This involves:

  * Filling out the application form.
  * Gathering supporting documentation such as:  
– Evidence of financial support  
– English language proficiency  
– Academic qualifications and  
– Other documentation as required.
  * Completion of health checks.



Application checklists can be found on [DHA’s website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/web-evidentiary-tool).

### Pre-Departure Briefing

A pre-departure briefing should be organised before students leave their home country. This briefing should cover all areas of a students stay in Australia and should provide realistic expectations of a student’s life in Australia.

Students need to be aware of:

  * Visa conditions
  * Reception procedures
  * A list of contacts for their arrival
  * Facilities
  * Cultural briefing
  * Student support services
  * Accommodation options and
  * Other relevant topics.
