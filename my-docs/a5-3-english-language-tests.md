### 1\. IELTS (International English Language Testing System)

[IELTS](http://www.ielts.org/) is the most commonly used English Proficiency test in Australia and is accepted by all our academic institutions. Also, US academic institutions are increasingly accepting IELTS for admissions purposes. 

The IELTS test consists of 4 modules that test the complete range of English language skills which students commonly encounter when studying or training in the medium of English. The IELTS test is available in two formats: Academic Training and General Training. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking Modules. However, the two formats have different Reading and Writing Modules.

The Academic test is suitable for candidates planning to undertake higher education study. The General Training test is suitable for candidates planning to undertake non-academic training or work experience, or for immigration purposes.

The IELTS test is also available on computer with results normally released within 5-7 days.

### 2\. The TOEFL test – (Test of English as a Foreign Language)

[TOEFL](http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.435c0b5cc7bd0ae7015d9510c3921509/?vgnextoid=69c0197a484f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD) tests the ability of candidates to use and understand English at a university level. Computer based testing is offered throughout most regions of the world. In addition, Internet-based tests (TOEFL® iBT) are also available in many countries. In areas where computer access is limited, a paper-and-pencil version of the test is administered. 

### 3\. CAE Cambridge test – (Certificate in Advanced English)

[CAE](http://cambridge-english-advanced.cambridgeesol.org/) is a thorough and demanding test of all areas of language ability of the candidate. It is available in a paper-based and a computer-based format. The CAE exam consists of five modules: reading, writing, use of English, listening and speaking (speaking is a face-to-face exam with two candidates and two assessors).

### 4\. The PTE Academic test – (Pearson Test of English – Academic)

[PTE Academic](https://www.pearson.com/en-au/student/english-language/pte-academic/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=Croud_PMax_UK&gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhKJBUUClSDGyjmNu_NZkJ2nm-A1Q0Cze8fOSvXNmAbMi6N4hcF7p2BoCzT0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) is a computer-based exam, measuring the individual’s English ability through tasks which reflect real-life settings. The test runs for 3 hours, during which candidates are given 20 different types of task. Some of these test integrated skills (e.g. reading AND speaking). Test results are delivered to test takers online (notification by email) within 5 working days.
