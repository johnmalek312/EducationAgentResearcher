### Qualifications

Agriculture, Environment and Veterinary Science disciplines are offered at the following qualifications levels:

Certificate| Y  
---|---  
Diploma| Y  
Advanced Diploma| Y  
Bachelor Degree| Y  
Graduate Certificate| Y  
Postgraduate Diploma| Y  
Masters by research/coursework| Y  
Professional Doctorates| N  
PhD| Y  
  
Most specialisations listed above are offered at all levels of academia. An exception to this is Veterinary Science. The Bachelor of Veterinary Science provides graduates with the qualification to practise as a Veterinarian. This course is only offered at the university level. In most other specialisations, pathways are available for students wanting to upgrade from Certificates to Diplomas to Advanced Diplomas and on to university studies.

Most qualifications at both vocational and university levels include practical hands on experience.

### Vocational Education and Training Programs

Typical programs offered at TAFE and private colleges include:

**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  
---|---  
Certificate| Certificate in Forest and Forest Products  
Certificate in Animal Studies/Animal Industry Practices  
Certificate IV in Captive Animals  
Diploma| Diploma of Agriculture  
Diploma of Conservation and Land Management  
Diploma of Horticulture  
Diploma of Seafood Industries  
Diploma of Veterinary Nursing  
Advanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Renewable Energy  
  
Typically, Certificates have the lowest entry requirements, and Advanced Diplomas the highest. Most agricultural, environmental and vet nursing courses offered through a TAFE or private college do not have pre-requisite subject requirements. Examples of typical entry requirements for this discipline include:

  * **Certificate I in Conservation and Management** – there are no specific entry requirements.
  * **Diploma of Agriculture** – completion of the equivalent of Australian grade 12 (including: completion of A Levels; All Indian Secondary School; or International Baccalaureate).



### University Programs

Entry requirements into Bachelor Degree programs are higher than vocational programs. Examples of courses offered in agriculture, environmental and veterinary science fields include:

**LEVEL**| **QUALIFICATION**  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Diploma of Applied Science;  
Bachelor of Agribusiness;  
Bachelor of Agricultural Science;  
Bachelor of Applied Science;  
Bachelor of Environmental Science/Management;  
Bachelor of Natural Resource Economics;  
Bachelor of Veterinary Science.  
Postgraduate| Masters of Tropical Veterinary Science;  
Masters by Research; and  
PhD.  
  
### Undergraduate

In most cases, for admission into an undergraduate program students are required to complete qualifications equivalent to Australian grade 12, as well as fulfilling subject prerequisites. Typically Veterinary Science has higher entry requirements than environmental based programs followed by agricultural based programs. For example:

  * **Bachelor of Agriculture** – entry requirements range from A Level requirement of 5 to 6 points and students must have achieved a pass in Chemistry or Physics and Mathematics at high school.
  * **Bachelor of Environmental Science** – entry requirements range from A Level requirements of 9 points down to 5 points and student must have achieved a pass in Chemistry or Physics and Mathematics at high school.
  * **Bachelor of Veterinary Science** – typically has an entry requirements of 13 A Level points and prerequisite subjects of Mathematics, English, Physics and Chemistry and has quota restrictions.



### Postgraduate

Postgraduate programs offered in this discipline provide:

  * re-training of non-professionals;
  * up-grading qualifications;
  * specialised training in specific fields.



The graduate courses designed for students without a relevant degree have lower entry requirements than those courses provided to students upgrading their qualifications in the field.

Postgraduate research programs usually require students to have completed a Bachelor Degree with Honours I or II. Select universities have pathways available to students wishing to complete a research degree without Honours.

### Pathways

There are several pathway options for students interested in the Agriculture and Environmental disciplines. Fewer pathways exist for students wanting to enrol in Veterinary Science. Many universities offer Diploma and Certificate program articulation pathways to Bachelor Degree levels.

### Professional Associations

Most of the programs offered within this discipline include hands-on practical experience such as: laboratory experiments; field studies and research assignments. This experience provides graduates with on-the-job skills before graduation.

Graduates may be eligible for membership at one of the following professional associations:

Agriculture| Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/))
