Australian schools are either government or non-government (private), and they aim to focus on the individual learning needs of their students.

### Government and Non-government Schools

There are some important differences between these 2 types of schools:

**GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS**| **NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS**  
---|---  
– they are operated by a State or Territory government.| – they are not owned or operated by a State or Territory government.  
– Australian students normally do not pay substantial tuition fees to attend these schools.  
  
– international students and the children of international students are required to pay fees.| – international students usually pay higher tuition fees than domestic students.  
– the marketing and enrolment of students is controlled by the government education department in the particular state or territory.  
  
– when agents recruit students for these schools, they communicate with a department representative and not the individual school.| – they recruit students directly, so agents communicate with non-government schools in all matters regarding recruitment and enrolment.  
– they address a variety of social and cultural philosophies.| – they may have a particular religious or cultural philosophy, which is clearly reflected in the student experience.

The school system aims to meet the learning needs of each individual student. This helps each child reach their full intellectual and educational potential. Study programs are child-centred and focus on the development of learning skills and strategies, which trains students to be life-long, self-motivated learners.

Australian schools usually have a number of characteristics:

**The teacher’s role**|  The teacher aims to assist students in reaching their individual learning goals.  
---|---  
**Class activities**|  Students commonly undertake projects, group work and self-directed learning.  
**Dress codes**|  Most schools enforce dress codes or have a uniform to promote a sense of equality and to maintain a focus on education instead of fashion.  
**Class sizes**|  These are kept as small as possible so that teachers can regularly interact with students on an individual basis.  
**School hours**|  Schools operate from 9am to 3pm, Monday to Friday. Before-school and after-school care is generally available to those students who require it.  
**Teacher training**|  All Australian teachers in secondary education and above are required to be university trained***** , with secondary school teachers having specialist qualifications in their subject area.  
**Special programs & services**| These are available for:  
– gifted students  
– students with disabilities  
to help them reach their fullest potential.  
**English support**|  International students often have access to English language support to help them adapt to their new school environment.  
  
***** There may be teachers in the current education system who aren’t university trained as they may have started teaching before this prerequisite was put into place.
