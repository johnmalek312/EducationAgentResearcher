### Overview

Agents handle two types of documents:

  1. **Academic**  
– student academic records  
– testimonials
  2. **Legal/Official**  
– student visa related documents  
– financial records  
– medical test results  
– personal declarations.



### Clear record keeping

**Agents need to be very organised and keep copies of all documents submitted in individual student files.** Any important telephone or face-to-face conversations relating to a student’s application should also be recorded as a written file note. It is also a common practice to send a follow-up email after such conversations to summarise/clarify what was agreed by both parties.

Files should not be destroyed until it is certain that the student has no further business with the agent. This may not be until the student has completely finished their course of study or has formally appointed another agent in their place.

Note that another individual may need to act on the material in a student’s file at a later date. So, the material in the file should be complete and easy to understand.

### Back-up of records

It is important to back up student records on a regular basis. This can be done electronically for example, to guard against a major loss such as a fire or theft.

### Privacy

Agents should observe privacy principles when dealing with students’ records. They should not disclose personal information to anyone who does not have a legitimate reason to access this information. Also, they should take reasonable steps to ensure the proper security of student information. 

### Verification

Agents can be asked to verify the authenticity of a document by an education provider, often by declaring that they have ‘sighted’ the original document.

Photocopies of documents are easily forged and care should be taken when accepting these. The educational provider will usually have a policy on the form of documents that they accept.
