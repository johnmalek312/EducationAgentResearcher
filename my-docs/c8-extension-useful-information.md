### Miscellaneous

​**University Student Union** (also known as a student guild or association):

  * Are present on most university campuses.
  * These are part of the network of student organisations that provides services and information to students.
  * Their aim is to promote interaction between students on campus and to meet specific interests.  
Here is an example from the [University of Melbourne](https://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/).



**Student clubs and organisations** :

  * These are groups which students themselves form to meet other students and to arrange activities of common interest.
  * They are usually supported by funds and facilities from the Student Union.
  * Typical clubs include sports clubs, national based groups, religious groups and political groups.



**Police units** :

  * These can be specifically set up to handle crime and serious issues relating to international students. The Victoria Police Asian Squad for example, monitors and intervenes in crimes such as violence, extortion and kidnapping where international students are involved.
  * They have police officers who speak a range of languages and who are dedicated to protecting the public, including students. These police units are helpful and trustworthy if a student reports a crime.



**Case Management** :

  * This describes the process of assessing, investigating and resolving a situation, which involves a vulnerable student.
  * It is used to manage and monitor services and support to resolve the issues for the student.
  * A typical case in international education might be that a student is in hospital after a car accident and a case manager is appointed by the education provider to ensure that relevant people are informed and take responsibility for ensuring the student is given support to recover and continue studying.
  * Case management processes are also commonly used in health care and in legal cases.
