The Migration Act 1958 and associated migration regulations are the national laws and regulations that govern the issuing of Student, Tourist and other visas. This is the responsibility of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) which is a Federal government department.

### What are the basic criteria for obtaining a student visa?

  * The student intends to study a course that is registered on CRICOS;
  * The student has a relevant electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for the course;
  * The student must have the appropriate financial capacity to study in Australia;
  * The student must have the appropriate academic background, including English language proficiency to study in Australia;
  * The student must demonstrate that they have adequate health insurance, no debts to the Australian government and are of “good character”;
  * If the student is under 18, some further requirements apply and
  * The student is a genuine temporary entrant.



### What other criteria may apply?

Other criteria may depend on the student’s country of origin and education sector they wish to study in. The Department of Home Affairs assesses the risk that a student will breach their visa conditions. The ​​ [Simplified Student Visa framework (SSVF)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/education-program/what-we-do/simplified-student-visa-framework) came into effect on 1 July 2016. Its features include:

  * international students apply for a single [Student visa (subclass 500)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500) regardless of their chosen course of study
  * student guardians apply for the [Student Guardian visa (subclass 590)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-590)
  * a single evidence level framework applies to all international students



All students and student guardians are generally required to lodge their visa application online by creating an account in [ImmiAccount](https://online.immi.gov.au/lusc/login).

[Weightings and immigration risk](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/education-program/what-we-do/evidence-levels) indicators used to calculate the immigration risk of student visa applications include: 

  * rate of visa cancellations (25% weighting)
  * rate of refusals due to a fraud reason (40% weighting)
  * rate of refusals (excluding fraud) (10% weighting)
  * rate of student visa holders becoming unlawful non-citizens (15% weighting)
  * rate of Subsequent Protection Visa applications (10% weighting)



If a provider and/or passport level are considered low risk, then it is possible to lodge a student visa application without evidence of English and financial resources.

### Student Visas, Tourist Visas and Working Holiday Visas

  * Not all students who come to Australia to study apply for a student visa. It is possible for some individuals to come to Australia on another type of visa, including a tourist visa which permits them to study for a maximum of three months and those on working holiday visas for a maximum of four months. Persons wishing to study in Australia for longer than this should apply for a Student visa.
  * Students studying Australian programs outside of Australia do not require a student visa.



### Registered Migration Agents

The Migration Act states that **in Australia** , only a Registered Migration Agent (RMA) is allowed to provide immigration assistance for individuals.

So, education agents working in Australia who are not RMAs need to be careful that they limit their advice to their clients to basic explanations and translations of student visa information that is publicly available on the DHA web site. They should not attempt a complex analysis of their clients’ migration circumstances. This may be a breach of the National Code 2018, Standard 4.6.1.
