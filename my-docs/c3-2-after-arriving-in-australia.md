At this stage, the management of the student involves:

  * Reception in Australia
  * Admission and Orientation
  * Course Commencement



### Reception in Australia

Australian education providers offer a range of reception services to make a student’s arrival in Australia as easy as possible. Some examples are given below.

**Airport Pickup** :

  * You can arrange for an institutional representative to pick up your students from the airport on their arrival. They then can be taken to temporary or permanent accommodation.
  * The airport pick-up fee is usually payable before arrival. Also, the education provider must have a record of the student’s flight details so that the representative is given the correct information about the student’s arrival (especially if the flight is delayed or arrives ahead of schedule).



**Accommodation** :

  * **Temporary accommodation**  
– can be provided to international students until they find something more permanent. This type of accommodation is ideal for students when they first arrive, so they can eventually decide where they would like to live for a longer period of time.
  * **Homestay**  
– is a common option for high school or ELICOS students and involves staying with an Australian family in their house. Terms vary but most homestay accommodation includes breakfast and dinner.
  * **On-campus accommodation**  
– is available at many education providers that have residences in the form of residential colleges or boarding houses. These usually have to be pre-booked before a student’s arrival in Australia.
  * **Off-campus accommodation**  
– can be arranged after a student’s arrival in Australia and is usually arranged independently of the education provider. Forms of off-campus accommodation include: rental houses or units, student residences operated by private organisations and student units or houses operated by private organisations.



**Other information** :

  * International students on reception in Australia may also receive information about opening bank accounts, the local environment, and orientation dates.



### Orientation and Admission

![](https://www.icef.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-photomix-company-518244-1024x683.jpg)

Each education provider will organise a student orientation before students commence their course. Orientation usually showcases the services and activities available to students during their study including academic planning advice, student support services, clubs and societies, and health care.

Note that universities can advise students to ‘enrol’ during the orientation period. Having a CoE means that the student has been accepted into the study program. They must then select subjects and tutorials at this time to finalise their study program.

### Course Begins

Once a semester commences there are two possible scenarios:

**1\. The Student withdraws**

**​** There are many reasons why this happens such as:

  * They are unhappy at the education provider or location they originally chose
  * They are homesick
  * A family crisis means they have to return home
  * *Their original course is inappropriate or
  * *They find a faster or better program of study that meets their needs.



_*Note that agents are expected to recommend appropriate courses to students. It is considered unethical to place a student in a course known to be inappropriate in order to collect a commission. This behaviour is also a breach of the National Code 2018, Standard 4.6._

The student may decide to return home or enrol in another education provider. In both of these situations:

  * the student may need to apply for a **refund**. Students should be made aware of the refund policy of the education provider they are attending. If a student withdraws after the advertised deadline then penalties could apply. Penalties usually include reduction in the refunded money and/or a withdrawal with penalty recorded on a students academic record.


  * the provider will also **inform DHA** that the student is no longer studying at that provider through PRISMS. If the student does not enrol in another course, the **student visa will be cancelled**.



If the student wishes to enrol in another education provider:

  * they must have a **letter of release** from the original provider and an **evidence of a full offer** from the new education provider.
  * DHA requires that a student will not be considered for a transfer for the first 6 months of their principal course unless there are clear grounds for this.
  * if the initial course was eligible for SVP and the proposed new course is not, the student’s visa may be cancelled based on the combined evidence of the student’s new education provider and country of citizenship.
  * the agent can collect their commission from the new provider.



**2\. Student starts their studies**

If a student starts their studies in their chosen program, you can invoice the education provider for your commission (as per the terms of your agency agreement with an education provider).

### Advice for student crises

During their course of study a student may come to you for advice concerning crises such as these:

  * **Medical** – an accident, or serious illness
  * **Financial** – student is unable to pay for their studies
  * **Visa** **compliance** – the student has breached the conditions of their visa
  * **Family** – some family matter has involved the student or
  * **Academic** – the student has difficulties succeeding in their studies.



In most cases an agent can only:

  * advise the student of their options
  * liaise with family members in their home country if appropriate and/or
  * redirect family members to sources of support.



For example, if a student has been excluded from an education provider on academic grounds, you can refer them to the relevant contacts (such as student support services) for advice on available appeal procedures.
