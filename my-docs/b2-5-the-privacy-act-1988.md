The [Privacy Act](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/) governs what information can be shared by institutions and agents about students. This law protects the rights of individuals to have their personal details dealt with confidentially.

However, some circumstances can create confusion for overseas students and their parents. In particular, for a student who is 18 or more years old: information that can be given to his/her parent is limited if there is no written direction from the student.
