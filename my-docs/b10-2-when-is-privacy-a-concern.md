There are two common circumstances in which an agent or parent may wish to find out more about the student in Australia. However, it is possible that they may not be able to obtain any information. These cases are:

### 1\. Academic progress and results

This circumstance is specific to a student who is 18 or more years old. This means the student is legally considered an adult under Australian law. So, information cannot be provided to anyone unless there is specific instruction from the student.

Question – Can an agent obtain information about a student’s academic progress in order to provide to a parent or guardian?

  * Yes – If the student gives his/her consent in writing for the education provider to provide the results.
  * No – If the student does not want to give his/her consent.
  * No – If the student is not available to give their consent. Academic results cannot be obtained even if the agent thinks that the student will agree to provide them.



### 2\. Medical situations

One of the most difficult circumstances concerns students who have medical problems. This is because the student’s parents may not speak English well and they may expect the agent to investigate the problem.

Question – What happens if a student is unable to communicate? For example, the student may have had a serious accident and may be unconscious.

  * The medical authorities may not agree to communicate with an agent or the education provider.
  * However, the medical authorities will always communicate with the student’s parents / wife / husband (unless the student has expressed a wish for them not to).



The medical authorities have the power to consider each case and its circumstances. They can decide to release sensitive medical information if they believe it is appropriate, and in the best interests of the student.

In these situations, it is better for an agent to work closely with the education provider. This is because the education provider is in a better position to obtain information, especially if the agent lives outside Australia.
