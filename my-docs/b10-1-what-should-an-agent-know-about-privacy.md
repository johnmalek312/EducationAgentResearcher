If you are an agent working in Australia

  * You are subject to the privacy laws;
  * You need to understand how information about individuals can be used.



If you are an agent working outside of Australia

  * you need to understand how some information cannot be given by certain institutions such as hospitals without the written permission of the student. This can be confusing if this does not occur in the student’s home country.



  
There are four general issues you need to be aware of:

**Collection of information**|  An agent or provider must only collect information that is necessary for its normal function. It cannot collect information about a student that is unrelated to its function.The student must know if information is collected.If practical, information can be only collected from the student and not from other sources.  
---|---  
**Use of information**|  An education provider must only use the information for the purpose that it was collected unless the student agrees to it being used for other purposes.  
**Security of information**|  An education provider must protect the student’s information from loss or misuse.  
**Access to information**|  The student must have access to the information on request.  
  
Standard 3.3.6 of [The National Code 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01182) states that a written agreement with a students must set out the circumstances in which personal information about the student may be disclosed by the registered provider, the Commonwealth including the TPS, or state or territory agencies, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988
