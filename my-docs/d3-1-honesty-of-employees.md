### Participants

  * You – a counsellor working in an agency
  * Another counsellor in your agency
  * Students in your country



### Situation

  * You learn that the other counsellor asks students to pay their tuition fees into his personal account.
  * He then pays the student’s fees on time using his own credit card.
  * He tells you that it helps the students because they don’t have to deal with anyone else in regard to their payment.
  * He tells you it helps him because he gains the reward points on his card every time he pays the student’s tuition fees.
  * He is a successful counsellor and students like working with him.



### Considerations

  * Should the counsellor use his personal credit card for business purposes?
  * Does the student know that the counsellor is gaining reward points?
  * Has the student been given other payment options?
  * Has the supervisor of the agency approved this?
