Students need to meet both a sufficient level of English language proficiency and the minimum academic requirements before they can be admitted to an Australian university.

### English language proficiency

Australian education institutions can only accept students with an appropriate level of English proficiency. Institutions set their own English language requirements. The language proficiency entry levels (e.g. IELTS, CAE or other) may be different from those required for a student visa.

If a student’s English language proficiency score is not high enough, there are many English language courses with starting dates throughout the year to prepare them for further study in Australia. All Australian universities either have their own English language centre or have links with English language colleges.

### Academic Requirements

Institutions are free to determine the academic requirements for entry to their courses. These requirements depend on:

  * The level and content of the education a student has completed in Australia or their home country
  * The level and academic standards of the institution at which they completed their study.



In general, however, the following criteria apply for undergraduate and postgraduate courses:

### Undergraduate courses

Undergraduate degrees require an Australian Senior School Certificate of Education (Year 12) or the overseas equivalent of this. Some degrees may also have certain pre-requisite subjects and grades.

For international students who have attended an Australian High School, entry to higher education institutions is normally based on completion of Year 12 and determined by the student’s tertiary entrance score or rank.

A tertiary admissions centre then assesses a student’s tertiary entrance rank in the same way as for domestic students:

**State/Territory**| **Tertiary Admission Centre**  
---|---  
Northern Territory| Charles Darwin University  
NSW & ACT| Universities Admissions Centre (UAC)  
Queensland| Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC)  
South Australia| South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre (SATAC)  
Tasmania| University of Tasmania  
Victoria| Victoria Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC)  
Western Australia| Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC)  
  
Most universities have specialised pathway programs, such as Foundation courses or Diploma programs that enable international students who do not meet academic requirements to gain entry.

### Postgraduate courses

Entry to postgraduate courses requires completion to a satisfactory standard of a Bachelor degree. Prospective students may also need to demonstrate research ability or relevant work experience.

### Costs of Australian Education for Overseas Students

University courses in Australia are comparable to those in other English speaking countries. For example, the cost of a Bachelor of Arts may be:

**Location**| **Yearly Cost**  
---|---  
Australia| AUD $30,000 to $45,000  
USA (public university)| AUD $40,000 to $60,000  
USA (private university)| Exceeding AUD $60,000  
UK| AUD $20,000 to $38,000  
  
In the Australian education system, some degrees are slightly shorter than in other countries. For example, some Bachelor degrees take three years in Australia but four years in the USA.
