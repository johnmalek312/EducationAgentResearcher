There are 5 general ways that you could use the information:

USE OF INFO| QUESTIONS AN AGENT MIGHT CONSIDER  
---|---  
1\. To compare agency recruitment performance against state and sector| – Did my agency record a decrease in enrolment numbers, despite an overall increase in international student enrolments for my country into a certain state and education sector?  
2\. To analyse core business against current statistics| – Is the demand for my services and representation a dying demand?  
– Should I consider changing the mix of business?  
  
For example, an agency specialising in ELICOS and primary and secondary education recruitment for Malaysian students may decide that the decreases experienced in these sectors in recent years indicate that opportunities for growth are limited and that there should be a realignment of the business to include other more popular sectors.  
3\. To identify market opportunities through horizontal growth| – Should I consider seeking additional institutional representation in other sectors and other states?  
– Should I consider opening another branch office in another country to service the growing student demand for Australian education there?  
4\. To identify market opportunities through vertical growth| – Is there an opportunity to add value by providing further services for international students?  
  
For example:

  * guardianship services


  * visa processing (employing an RMA)


  * friends and family visiting tours


  * academic staff study tours


  * tourism services.

  
5\. To analyse recruitment and marketing strategies| – If my agency recruits students mainly through advertisements in the local school newsletters and seminars at the local high schools, will this still be a reliable method for recruiting students if I change my business mix?
