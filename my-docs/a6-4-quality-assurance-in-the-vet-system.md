### Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA)

The vocational education and training (VET) Quality Framework is aimed at achieving national consistency in the way providers are registered and monitored and in how standards in the vocational education and training (VET) sector are enforced.

[ASQA](http://www.asqa.gov.au/about-asqa/national-vet-regulation/vet-quality-framework.html) is the body which sets these standards and provides organisations with the approval to offer VET courses. There are two elements to the VET Quality Framework:

  * Standards that govern the operations of the organisations ([Registered Training Organisations](https://www.asqa.gov.au/rtos/what-is-an-rto))
  * Standards that govern the nature of the VET courses ([Training Packages and Accredited Courses](https://www.asqa.gov.au/course-accreditation))



There are 8 VET qualifications which are part of the The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF):

  * Certificates I, II, III and IV
  * Diploma and Advanced Diploma
  * Vocational Graduate Certificate and Vocational Graduate Diploma.



### 1\. Registered Training Organisations

The NVR Standards for Registered Training Organisations requires them to:

  * Have documented systems for quality training and assessment
  * Have documented agreements with other organisations when they provide training or assessment in partnership
  * Have written procedures for recruitment, induction and professional development of staff
  * Use trainers and assessors (teachers) with specified skills
  * Follow specific requirements for assessment strategies and
  * Demonstrate that their owners/CEO are suitable individuals to operate an education organisation.



### 2\. Training Packages and Accredited Courses

[Training packages](http://www.asqa.gov.au/about/australias-vet-sector/training-packages1.html) are developed to meet the training needs of an industry, or a group of industries. They specify the skills and knowledge required to perform effectively in the workplace.

Each training package is made up of three components:

  * **Units of competency** : which define the skills and knowledge to operate effectively and how they need to be applied to perform effectively in a workplace context.
  * **Qualifications framework** : groups of units of competency ranging from Certificate I to Vocational Graduate Diploma level.
  * **Assessment guidelines** : the industryâ€™s preferred approach to assessment, including the qualifications required by assessors, the design of assessment processes and how assessments should be conducted.



Where there are no training packages for a particular workplace available, a VET course may be [accredited](http://www.asqa.gov.au/course-accreditation/accreditation-with-asqa/accreditation-with-asqa.html) by an organisation. There are specific standards and requirements for all accredited courses and each VET accredited course is allocated a national code and is listed on the national register,[ ](http://training.gov.au/)[training.gov.au](https://training.gov.au/).
