Australia’s Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector offers a large variety of qualifications for students with a strong practical orientation. According to the Department of Education , in 2022 there were 199,909 international student enrolments in VET courses in Australia (find latest figures [here](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-monthly-summary-and-data-tables)).

### The Students

VET students are typically:

  * schools leavers seeking to acquire practical skills for work
  * school leavers seeking an alternative pathway to university
  * workers who are seeking to further develop their career skills
  * university graduates who need to acquire practical skills for the work or
  * those simply wishing to develop their personal interests.



### The Institutions

The Australian VET system is publicly and privately funded and is delivered by a wide variety of training institutions and enterprises.

A comprehensive database of institutions offering VET qualifications can be found at the Training.gov.au website.

**TAFE – Technical and Further Education**

There are currently 59 TAFE institutes that deliver VET training across Australia. They are government funded, they provide post-school education and training, and they usually have a more practical focus than university courses.

TAFE colleges act independently of one another and have their own premises, courses, and academic and administrative staff.

TAFEs can be very large institutions and have more students enrolled than many Universities. For example, most city-based TAFEs have over 50,000 enrolments. The facilities available to students are similar to those in a University. Also, they operate across a number of campuses as well as in industry and community venues.

TAFE institutes contain some of the largest ELICOS centres in Australia. They are also sometimes part of a University. For example, every university in Victoria except one has a TAFE division.

TAFE courses are often used by international students as a pathway to undergraduate programs at university, especially via the Diploma route. Some TAFEs offer university degrees through affiliated universities, and some offer their own degrees.

**Private Colleges**

There are approximately 5000 other registered providers of VET courses. These range from small institutions that offer specialised courses in one particular area of study to large private colleges which are similar to larger TAFE institutes.

A wide variety of VET courses are offered through private colleges. The most popular courses for international students are those related to Business and Information Technology.

Like TAFE, private colleges are popular with international students as pathway institutions, since they can provide entry to university studies after completing a VET qualification. Also, some private institutions offer university programs through affiliated universities, and others offer their own degrees.

**VET in Schools**

Over 95 per cent of Australia’s secondary schools that offer senior secondary programs also offer VET programs to their senior students. This means students can study their senior secondary certificate and they can also be trainees and employees by participating in a work-based pathway, gaining practical work skills and VET qualifications as part of their school education.
