### Participants

  * You â€“ a counsellor working in an agency
  * A prospective student in your country



### **Situation**

  * The student is keen to study Engineering in Australia.
  * She is not sure about which university or location to study at.
  * She wants to apply to as many courses as possible.
  * She compiles a list of 20 engineering courses across Australia.



### Considerations

  * Should you send applications to all 20 institutions?
  * Is she likely to be accepted into all the institutions?
  * What is an acceptable balance to provide a student with suitable options but not generate administrative work for institutions?
