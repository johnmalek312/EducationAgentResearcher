  * Australia’s [multicultural society](https://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/English/Why-Australia/reasons-to-study-in-australia) is sophisticated and largely harmonious.
  * More than 300 ethnic groups are represented in Australia, making Australia one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world.
  * Approximately 29% of the population is born overseas, and 48% have at least one parent born outside Australia.
  * International students are readily accepted by other students, and teachers are experienced in teaching classes to students from many countries.
  * Australians respect the freedom of people to practise their choice of religion. Churches, mosques, temples and synagogues are located in most major cities.

  * Australians are open, relaxed and friendly people so students usually find a warm welcome in Australia. Many students living in homestay situations experience Australian family life in a natural way and often find they are treated like a family member.
  * Even though there are only 26 million people in Australia, as of early 2024, Australia hosts approximately 717,500 international students, making it rank as having the second highest share of international students globally, trailing only behind Luxembourg.
  * Whether staying in homestay, boarding school or campus accommodation there are many opportunities to make lasting friendships.



### Unique environment and experiences
