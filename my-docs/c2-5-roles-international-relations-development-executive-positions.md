### International Relations/Development

**TITLE**| **RESPONSIBILITIES**| **CONTACT WITH AGENT**  
---|---|---  
**Manager of International Relations**  
  
Also known as: – Deputy Director  
– Marketing and Promotions Manager  
– International Marketing Manager| 

  * In charge of an institution’s international development and investigating international opportunities.In some smaller institutions such as TAFE, private colleges and ELICOS centres, this role is the responsibility of the International Marketing Manager.

| 

  * If you were approached by an international institution wanting to develop an alliance with an Australian institution, you might contact this person.

  
**Project Officer**| 

  * Supports the Manager of International Relations and coordinates the operational aspects of investigating opportunities.

|

### Executive Positions

**TITLE**| **RESPONSIBILITIES**| **CONTACT WITH AGENT**  
---|---|---  
**Vice-Chancellor**| 

  * The overall strategic and operational running of the University. 

| 

  * There would be no reason for you to contact the Vice Chancellor directly; however, you might meet them at ceremonial events such as overseas graduations.

  
**Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International)**| 

  * Overall strategic and operational running of the institution’s international portfolio

| 

  * There would be very few circumstances where you would need to contact the Deputy Vice-Chancellor directly. You might have the opportunity to meet with the Deputy Vice-Chancellor if you visit the institution or if the Deputy Vice-Chancellor is visiting the country where you operate.

  
**International Director**| 

  * The operational running of the International Directorate or Office.

| 

  * You would contact the Director in high-level situations such as: the death of a student; a student being arrested in Australia; or a student going missing.
  * In schools and smaller organisations, you might have more contact with the International Director or Principal. For example, in a school, the International Director may encompass the roles of marketing, development and admissions. In this case the Director would be your main contact.

  
**ELICOS/College Director**| 

  * The operational running of the College or ELICOS Centre.

| 

  * Depending on the size of the institution, your contact with this person can range from minimal (only meeting them on ceremonial occasions) to frequent (when this role also encompasses development and marketing).

  
**Principal**| 

  * All aspects of the operational running of the school.

| 

  * There is a lot of variation regarding how much contact an agent might have. In some schools, the Principal has a very large role in marketing and may wish to meet every agent or undertake marketing trips. In others, these functions are the responsibilities of others.
