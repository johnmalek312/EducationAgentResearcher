All of Australiaâ€™s universities are established or recognised under government legislation. The Federal Government has responsibility for funding the public universities.

The formal governing body of each Australian university is the Council, Senate or Board of Governors. This is presided over by a Chancellor who is elected by the members of the governing body. Members are drawn from government, industry, the community, academic staff, graduates and students.

The chief executive authority rests with the Vice-Chancellor who is sometimes also called the President. This person is accountable to the Council, Senate or Board of Governors and is responsible for the academic and administrative operations of the institution.

Teaching and research disciplines are typically organised in several faculties and schools with dedicated Research Centres linking into the faculties. There are also a number of administrative divisions.

To see an example of a typical university structure, look at these web pages from the University of Queensland:
