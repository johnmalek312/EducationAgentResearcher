### Population

Australia is one of the least densely populated countries in the world. This is due to its small population and its large area of approximately 7.7 million square kilometres. These statistics about population, economy and area are from the ABS:

COUNTRY| AREA  
(km2)| DENSITY  
(people per km2)  
---|---|---  
Australia| 7,703,556.6| 2.85  
Canada| 9,971,000| 3  
Japan| 377,000| 336  
New Zealand| 268,000| 14  
United Kingdom| 242,000| 244  
United States of America| 9,809,000| 29

Australians are among the most urbanised people in the world. For example, just over 60% of them live in the capital cities and about 20% live in Sydney. Also, around 80% of the inhabitants of each state and territory live within 100 km of their capital cities. The following statistics are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from the 2021 census. You can find the full report [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/population-census/2021):

  * The 2021 Census counted **25,422,788** people in Australia (excluding overseas visitors), an increase of 8.6 per cent since the 2016 Census.
  * 49.3 per cent of the population were male with a median age of 37 years old.
  * 50.7 per cent of the population were female with a median age of 39 years old.

State / Territory| Area  
(km2)| Capital

---|---|---|---  
NSW| 801,150| Sydney| 8,072,163  
VIC| 227,416| Melbourne| 6,503,491  
QLD| 1,727,000| Brisbane| 5,156,138

### Multiculturalism

Australians pride themselves on their friendliness and cultural diversity. The population lives in a generally safe, friendly, sophisticated and harmonious society. Many ethnic groups are represented in Australia, making it one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world.

Australia’s diversity is described here:

  * Over 28% of Australians were born in another country.
  * 21% of Australians have at least one parent who was born overseas.
  * Australian migrants are from more than 190 countries;
  * 2.8% of Australians are of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent.



### Languages

Although English is the official language in Australia, there are more than 200 languages spoken in Australian households.

Some interesting figures from the 2016 Australian Census of Population and Housing:

  * more than one-fifth of Australians speak a language other than English at home (4,858,804 people)
  * over 64,000 Australians speak an Indigenous language at home 
  * about 7% of the total population speaks one of the six most commonly spoken languages (other than English) at their home.



The ABS provided these statistics about the number and proportion of people who spoke a language other than English at home in 2016:

Language| Number of  
people| Proportion of  
population (%)  
---|---|---  
Mandarin| 596,711| 2.5  
Arabic| 321,728| 1.4  
Cantonese| 244,600| 1.2  
Vietnamese| 277,400| 1.2  
Italian| 271,597| 1.2  
Greek| 237,125| 1.0  
Tagalog (Filipino)| 182,498| 0.8  
Hindi| 159,637| 0.7  
  
The Australian accent is easy to understand. While there are some minor differences in accent between city and country areas, the difference is much less than you would find in the USA, Britain or Canada.  


### Religion

Australia is predominantly a Christian country; however, all religions are represented in Australian society and people are free to practise their choice of religion. Churches, mosques, temples and synagogues are located in most major cities.

Major religious affiliations for the years 1901, 2001, 2011 and 2016 are compared below  
(from the [ABS](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/636F496B2B943F12CA2573D200109DA9?opendocument)):

Census year| Christian (%)| Other religions (%)| No religion (%)  
---|---|---|---  
1901| 96.1| 1.4| 0.4  
2001| 68.0| 4.9| 15.5  
2011| 61.1| 7.2| 22.3  
2016| 52.1| 8.2| 30.1
