#### **Situation**

  * You have recently set up a new agency to work both onshore and offshore.
  * You place advertisements in papers in New Delhi and in Melbourne advertising your services.
  * The advertisements offer assistance with identifying study opportunities in Australia with migration pathways, finding suitable accommodation and obtaining a visa.



#### **Considerations**

  * What are the regulations that control visa advice?
  * Are there any differences between what can be advertised in New Delhi and in Melbourne?
