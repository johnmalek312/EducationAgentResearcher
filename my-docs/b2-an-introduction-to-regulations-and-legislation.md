### Overview

International education in Australia is controlled by a number of Acts of Parliament and associated regulations at both the Federal and the State level.

This lesson outlines how these operate and which government department is in charge of each.

Note that regulations often refer to education institutions as “the provider” or the “registered provider”.

### Focus Questions

  1. Why does Australia regulate its International Education Industry?
  2. How is this regulation achieved?
  3. What roles do the Federal and State Governments have?
  4. How familiar are you with your Agent responsibilities?
