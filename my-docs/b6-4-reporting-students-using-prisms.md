Education agent counsellors are not permitted to create a Student Course Variation (SCV) so this section is for your information only.

Students **are not** reported if:

  * They follow the same pathway that they originally intended;
  * The details on their eCoE do not need to be changed in any way.



If any changes are necessary, the institution uses PRISMS to produce a **Student Course Variation (SCV).**

### Reporting for Changes in Details

Generally, the following events require an educational provider to use PRISMS to report to the student to DHA:

  * The student does not begin the course;
  * The student finishes the course before the date on the CoE;
  * The student leaves the provider;



In these cases, the provider would report on the student using the appropriate SCV code and create new CoEs as required. Depending on the circumstances, the student may or may not need to be directly involved.

Students wishing to change provider do not need to approach DIPB unless they are changing the sector of the principal course of study.

### Reporting for non-compliance of Student Visa Conditions

There are two reasons why an educational provider uses PRISMS to report students to DHA for non-compliance:

  * Non attendance in classes;
  * Unsatisfactory academic performance.



For these two reasons, the student is breaching the conditions of their student visa, so:

  * During the reporting process, PRISMS generates a formal letter that is sent to the student. This letter asks them to explain their circumstances to DHA.
  * The letter states that the student has 28 days to make an appointment at a DHA office.
  * If the student does not make an appointment, then his/her visa may be cancelled.



**Current postal address**  
If the student has not provided the institution with a current postal address, the formal letter may not reach the student. Consequently, the student may not realise that an appointment is necessary. In this situation:

  * the student visa is still cancelled, because it is the studentâ€™s responsibility to ensure the provider has their current postal address.



**A valid reason for non-compliance**  
The student may have a valid reason for the non-compliance. For example, the student was sick (the student also needs to have medical certificates to prove this). After the interview with the student, DHA may decide not to cancel the visa.
