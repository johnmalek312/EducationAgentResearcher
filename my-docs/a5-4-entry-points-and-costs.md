Students may enter an ELICOS college with any level of English proficiency. However, the Department of Home Affairs (which is responsible for Immigration and Citizenship) assigns certain requirements to student visas for students from certain countries. This means that some students may only be able to study an English course for a limited length of time, depending on their nationality and sector in which they seek to study. 

Australian education institutions can only accept students with an appropriate level of English proficiency and institutions are free to set their own English language requirements. There may be different language proficiency levels, different measures (eg. IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, PTE Academic) or other ways used to satisfy the language requirement of different institutions for their courses. This may be other than and/or in addition to the levels required for a student visa by DIBP.

**You should check the English level entry requirements with education providers.**

### Cost of English language courses

The average tuition costs are $305 per week, but course prices vary depending on:

  * the centre
  * the centreâ€™s location and
  * the length of the course.



Study tour prices are specific to the study program and subject to negotiation.
