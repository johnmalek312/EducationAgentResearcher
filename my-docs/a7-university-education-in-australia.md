### Overview

The higher education sector consists mainly of universities but also government and private institutions. This sector contributes to Australian society and Australia’s international reputation in so many ways.

As an education agent, you need to be able to describe the important and unique characteristics of this sector to your students, and help them plan learning pathways for them that are realistic and the most appropriate.

### Focus Questions

  1. What kinds of qualifications does the higher education sector provide?
  2. What is the organisational structure of a university?
  3. What proportion of universities and their campuses are located in capital cities?
  4. How is the quality of higher education providers maintained?
  5. How can you determine which universities are the best?
  6. What is “internationalisation” and why is this vital to Australia’s education industry?
