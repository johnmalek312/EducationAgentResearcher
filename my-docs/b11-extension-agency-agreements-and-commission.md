### Agency Agreements (contracts)

**Must institutions review and update all their current contracts with their education agents?**  
---  
Institutions should review the agreements they have in place to ensure they are compliant with the National Code 2018.  
**Can institutions pay a commission to education agents who approach them if they don’t have a written agreement with the agent?**  
Yes. Institutions may pay a commission if they do not have a formal agreement with the agent. However they must enter into a written agreement if the relationship changes to an ongoing one where the agent formally represents the institution.  
**Does an institution need to state on a student’s letter of offer that they do not have a written agreement with an agent?**  
The provider does not have to advise an intending student whether or not they have a written agreement with an education agent.  
**Is an agent without an agreement deemed to be representing the student?**  
It is not that an agent without an agreement is deemed to be ‘representing the student’. It is that the institution has not formally engaged the agent to represent it and recruit students for the institution.  
**In their agreements with agents, should providers stop agents giving their commission to students as a way of reducing the students’ tuition? Can an agent give a student their entire commission?**  
An agent can give a student their commission to reduce the student’s tuition fees. If an institution wanted to prevent this practice they could incorporate the condition into the written agreement with the agent.Except for the requirements prescribed by Standard 4, the content of the business arrangement between the provider and the agent is a matter for the provider and agent to determine and agree.  
**Is an agreement that states that the agent must be ‘independent’ and ‘not the agent of the provider, but the agent of the student’ compliant with the National Code 2018?**  
The test for assessing this is to initially ask: Is the agent formally representing the institution? If the agent is not, and they are representing the student, why does the institution have an agreement with them?If the agreement has terms and conditions relating to the scope of the agent’s promotional activities, commissions and the like, then the agent is formally representing the institution regardless of additional provisions it may contain.  
**Are providers who engage education agents to recruit only a small number of students required to have a written agreement?**  
Yes, whenever a provider engages education agents to recruit students on its behalf, a written agreement is required.  
  
### Commission

Commission is a form of payment to an education agent by the education institution for their services. It is usually paid upon the student commencing their studies and may be paid at periodic intervals (normally each semester) while the student remains enrolled in their course.

The commission is usually a percentage of the tuition fee. This percentage is set in the written agreement between the provider and the education agent. Standard commission rates vary from 12-15% of the tuition fee for a formal qualification and 20-35% for ELICOS courses.

It is not uncommon for providers to increment the commission for their agents based on their performance (e.g. after the first 15 enrolled students the agent will be paid 5% of the tuition fee, then for the next 15 students this fee increases to 10% and if the agent recruits more than 30 students, their commission may be 15%)

In cases where the provider doesn’t have a written contract with the agent, they still can pay commission. In these cases it is possible that the provider informs the prospective student (e.g. in the letter of offer), that they do not have an agreement with this agency and therefore the provider is not required under Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) to take responsibility for the activities of the agent. The provider may wish to explain this situation further to the student.

However, according to the National Code 2018, if the relationship becomes ongoing, then a written agreement must be signed by both parties.

Some agents give part or whole of their commissions back to their student as an incentive. This is not considered an unethical practice. If the institution wanted to stop/prevent this, the signed contract with the institution will explicitly state that this cannot be done by the agency.
