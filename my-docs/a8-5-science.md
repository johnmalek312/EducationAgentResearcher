### Qualifications

Science programs are offered in the following qualification levels:

  * Certificate
  * Diploma
  * Advanced Diploma
  * Bachelor Degree
  * Graduate Certificate
  * Postgraduate Diploma
  * Masters by research/coursework
  * PhD



TAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational science training through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs.

However, there are some exceptions. Select TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs. Universities may offer Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.

### Vocational Education and Training Programs

Vocational Education Programs available in this discipline are skills specific. Examples of awards include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Certificate| Certificate III in Marine Science;  
Certificate IV in Laboratory Techniques.  
Diploma| Diploma of Food Technology;  
Diploma of Science.  
  
Typically, students are required to have completed the equivalent of grade 10 for admission into Certificate programs and the equivalent of grade 12 for admission into the Diploma programs.

### University Programs

Students are most likely to enrol in one of the following programs:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Bachelor of Science (BSc);  
Bachelor of Applied Science (BAppSci);  
Bachelor of Biotechnology.  
Postgraduate| Graduate Certificates;  
Postgraduate Diplomas;  
Masters of Science (MSc);  
Masters of Applied Science;  
PhD.  
  
Typical entry requirements:

  * **Bachelor of Science (Marine Biology) or Bachelor of Applied Science (Astrophysics)** – A Levels entry requirements range from 5 to 10 points. Typically, students are required to have completed pre-requisite courses of Mathematics and at least two Science subjects as part of their high school certificate. Some universities do offer these courses as part of the Science degree but they are studies without credit towards the degree.



All programs involve laboratory experiments and some fieldwork.

### Pathways

Pathways are available for students who wish to enter undergraduate science programs, such as foundation courses. However, few pathways are available for students wishing to transfer with credit from Vocational to Higher Education qualifications.

### Professional Associations

Graduated students may be eligible for membership in the following professional bodies:

Astronomy| 

  * International Astronomical Union ([IAU](http://www.iau.org/))
