Australian VET qualifications have been popular amongst international students for many years. Entry requirements vary greatly from institution to institution and from course to course.

In general, to begin a certificate level course, students need:

  * a qualification equivalent to Grade 10-12 in an Australian high school
  * an English language proficiency level of IELTS 6.0 or equivalent (previously 5.5). For packaged  
ELICOS courses, the requirement is now 5.0, up from 4.5.



### Recognition of Prior Learning

Entry requirements above certificate level may take into account previous training and experience within an industry. This process is known as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).

RPL allows a person to receive recognition and credit for the knowledge and skills they have, no matter how and where they were attained, including overseas. This can include skills from:

  * previous study – including courses at school or college, through adult education classes or training programs at work
  * work experience – including both work that is paid and unpaid
  * life experience – for example leisure pursuits or voluntary work.

To obtain RPL, it is important that a student’s knowledge and skills help to meet the learning outcomes and assessment criteria of the qualification that the student is seeking credit for. RPL assessment can result in a full qualification or a Statement of Attainment for partial completion.

**You can approach the educational institution that a student wishes to study at and ask for further details about RPL assessment.** Also, assessment-only Registered Training Organisations will assess a student’s skills and experience on a fee-for-service basis.

### Cost of VET for Overseas Students

Course fees vary greatly depending on the course and/or the institution. As a general guide, international students are charged tuition fees of $5,500 to $22,000 (AUD) per year. The average tuition fee is approximately $10,000 per year.
