### Overview

Agents often need to explain the relevance of a given course to a student in relation to their proposed career path. This lesson provides an overview of courses and career pathways available through Australian TAFE colleges, private colleges and universities in the following disciplines:

  * Business and Economics
  * Law
  * Agriculture, Environment and Veterinary Science
  * Health
  * Science
  * Engineering and Technology
  * Architecture and Building
  * Creative Industries
  * Humanities, Social Science and Education.



Information on programs and entry requirements in this lesson are general and typical. **Agents should refer to the relevant institution for specific requirements for programs they offer.**

When referring to entry requirements, this lesson uses points awarded for A-level subjects:

**SUBJECT  
GRADE**| **POINTS**  
---|---  
A| 5  
B| 4  
C| 3  
D| 2  
E| 1  
  
For example, a university may specify an entry requirement of B-B-C in 3 subjects, which equals 11 points (= 4 + 4 + 3). Note that AS-levels are equivalent to half points (eg. A = 2.5).

### Focus Questions

  1. How do the entry requirements for Diploma and Advanced Diploma courses tend to differ from Bachelor degree courses?
  2. For each of the disciplines listed above, what are some of the specialisations that students could study and what careers might they lead to?
  3. What are some professional associations that students could join upon completing their undergraduate studies?
