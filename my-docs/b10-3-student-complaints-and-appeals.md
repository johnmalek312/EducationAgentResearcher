### Overview

If international students do not get the services they pay for, they have a right to complain. When they have an adverse judgement made against them, (such as failing a subject or not meeting the attendance requirement), they have the right to appeal the decision. In the first instance, these matters will be dealt with internally and the education provider will have a complaints and appeals process that should be followed.

The [Commonwealth Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/) deals with complaints made against any private educational institution. Government institutions use a State Ombudsman or range of Tribunals (depending on the nature of the complaint or appeal to serve the same purpose. See this [website for more information](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/support-while-you-study/higher-education-student-complaints#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20is%20to,ask%20them%20about%20their%20process.).

If the student wishes to make a complaint, an agent may be asked to help the student understand the process they need to follow or they may be the subject of the complaint themselves.

### What do overseas students complain about?

Students can complain about their education provider if they believe the provider may not have followed the rules correctly or treated them fairly. The common complaints according to the OSO are:

1\. Refund & fee disputes (28%)  
2\. Transfer/release letter external appeals (16%)   
3\. Unsatisfactory attendance external appeals (11%)   
4\. Unsatisfactory course progress external appeals (9%)

Complaints might also be about:

  * being refused admission to a course
  * course fees and due dates
  * graduation/completion certificates/academic transcripts
  * cancellation of enrolment
  * accommodation or work arranged by a provider
  * incorrect advice given by a provider’s agent
  * inaction or delay, for example, failure by a provider to issue student results within the normal timeframes, or failure to provide services that were included in the student’s written agreement with the education provider.



The OSO do not investigate complaints where a student took more than 12 months to complain.

### The Process

When a complaint is received, an assessment is first made about whether it is an issue that the OSO can investigate. In some cases, the Ombudsman may decide not to investigate a complaint. This might be because:

  * the student has not complained to the education provider first, or
  * another organisation is better able to deal with the complaint.(e.g. the police if it is a criminal matter)
  * If a decision is made to investigate a complaint, the Ombudsman will ask the education provider about the problem. The Ombudsman may request relevant documents, or information such as student records from the provider.



The OSO can use formal powers to obtain documents from the education institution and also has the power to enter premises or require a provider to answer questions as part of an investigation.

### What happens at the end of an investigation?

At the end of an investigation the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider has not acted unreasonably, and will advise the student and the provider of this decision.

In other cases, the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider failed to take appropriate action or the action appears to have been:

  * contrary to law
  * unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory or
  * otherwise, in all the circumstances, wrong.



Where that happens, the OSO may recommend that a provider remedy the problem for example by:

  * apologising to a student
  * reconsidering a decision affecting a student
  * providing a refund
  * providing clearer information or
  * changing a policy or procedure.



### Students also complain about their agents

Common complaints about agents:

  * Giving false or misleading advice about a course or provider
  * Enrolling a student with one provider while telling the student they had been enrolled with a different provider 
  * Accepting tuition fees before the student signed the written agreement 
  * Failing to pass on tuition fees to the provider 
  * Failing to give the student a copy of the written agreement, with the refund policy, so the student is unaware of their rights 
  * Receiving a refund on behalf of a student when not authorised to do so in the student’s written agreement with the provider
  * Receiving a refund on behalf of a student when authorised to do so but then failing to give the refund to the student
  * Arranging sub-standard accommodation in Australia and failing to assist the student when they complained
