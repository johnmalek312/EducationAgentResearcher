### Overview

**CRICOS** is the [**Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students**](https://cricos.education.gov.au/). It is an online register of all the courses and institutions that are available to students who wish to obtain a student visa.

Institutions offering education or training services to students studying in Australia on student visas are required to comply with the Federal legislative requirements for registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).

Some students may study a short course on another type of visa (tourist or working holiday visa) which permits them to study for a short period and may not be listed on CRICOS. Such students in Australia on visas other than student visas are not covered under the ESOS Act.
