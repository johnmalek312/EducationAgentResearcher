#### Attendance

A student must attend at least 80% of their scheduled lessons, unless they are enrolled in a higher education (i.e. University) course. If this does not happen, then:

  * The education provider will have documented policies and procedures stating whether they will consider compassionate and compelling circumstances;
  * The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. The letter must also inform the student they have 20 working days within which to access the provider’s complaints and appeals process.



Once this timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalised and found in favour of the provider, the provider reports the breach of the student visa condition using PRISMS.

The student will then receive a notice informing them that they must attend at an Immigration office within 28 days. Should they not do this, their visa may be cancelled.

#### Academic performance

A student must achieve satisfactory academic results. However, often an institution cannot immediately exclude the student for failure and so the student continues on their Student visa. In this situation the student needs to follow the relevant appeal process. If the appeal is unsuccessful, then:

  * The education provider must have documented policies and procedures for monitoring course progress and determining when a student has failed to make satisfactory course progress;
  * The provider must issue the student a written notification of their intention to report the student to DHA. The letter must also inform the student they have 20 working days within which to access the provider’s complaints and appeals process.



Once this timeframe has lapsed or the appeals process has been finalised and found in favour of the provider; the provider reports the visa breach using PRISMS.

#### Current address

The student must keep the education provider informed of their current address in Australia. This is because all formal notices are sent to this address. If the address changes, the student must inform the education provider within 7 days.

An under 18 student must have the approval of their education provider to move to another address if they are not living with a parent, guardian or relative.

#### Changing courses and institutions

##### _Changing Course_

If a student wants to stay at the same institution but wants to change courses with the same AQF level they will not require a new student visa. 

If the new course is longer than the original course, the student should apply for a further Student visa before their visa expires. If a student wishes to undertake a shorter course than that for which the visa was granted, when they have completed the shorter course they must, within 28 days, either depart Australia or, if they wish to enrol in a further course of study, notify DHA and apply for a new student visa if it is required.

A student must remain enrolled in a course at the same or higher AQF level for which their visa has been granted (unless changing from AQF 10 to AQF 9). If the student wishes to change to a lower level program, they should apply for a new Student visa. Otherwise a student is in breach of their visa conditions and may liable for visa cancellation or the refusal of a subsequent application. DHA place a particular focus on;

  * Students who change their course very soon after arrival in Australia
  * Large changes in level e.g. Bachelor courses to Cert III
  * Change to very different course types



Where students are studying in Non-AQF courses (i.e. Foundation programs, ELICOS) and they wish to change to an AQF course, this would be acceptable. In contrast, the reverse is not be normally allowed, e.g. changing from an undergraduate program to a stand alone ELICOS program.

Student breaches do not involve automatic cancellations of visas, but any breaches of visa conditions do risk visa cancellation.

##### _Changing Institution_

If a student has not completed six months of their principal course and wants to change education provider, Standard 7 of the ESOS National Code sets out the circumstances in which this will be possible. Unless special circumstances apply, they are required to have the permission of the existing education provider (through a letter of release) in order to transfer to another education provider.

The education provider must assess a request to transfer a student and all education providers have documented procedures on their transfer policy. Agents should make sure they understand their education provider’s transfer policy, and the written agreement with the student, before attempting to enrol a student with a new education provider.

If an education provider does not give permission to transfer to another education provider and the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the process, they should first access the internal appeal process with the education provider. If still not satisfied, they can appeal the education provider’s decision at an external complaints handling body, such as the State or Territory Ombudsman or the Overseas Student Ombudsman.

If the student has completed six months of the principal course, no permission from the current institution is required.

In cases where students have been granted a student visa based on streamlined evidentiary requirements and they change to a provider that may have otherwise required regular evidentiary requirements, DHA may request evidence of financial capacity and English proficiency from the student. 

#### Travel

Students can enter and leave Australia as often as necessary while they have a current student visa. Students must check that their passport will not expire while they are outside of Australia.

If they obtain a new passport after they have already got a student visa, they must inform DHA of the new passport details before they travel overseas.

If an under 18 student has their welfare arrangements approved by their education provider, they will not be able to travel to Australia until the date their provider nominated as the start date for the approved arrangements.

#### Duration of visa

The visa has an expiry date.

In the case of a student who is under the age of 18 whose welfare arrangements are being approved by their education provider, the expiry date of the visa will be in accordance with the end of the students approved welfare arrangements as indicated on the students CAAW.

#### An expired visa

If a student’s visa expires and they are still in Australia without having any other visas, they become “unlawful” and should contact DHA immediately.

If they do not contact DHA within 28 days after the expiry date, they will not be eligible for the grant of most types of visas, including a further Student visa in Australia and may then be subject to a risk factor called an ‘Exclusion Period’.

An exclusion period prevents a person from being granted certain visas, including student visas, for a period of three years after last departing Australia unless certain circumstances apply.

#### A cancelled visa

Similar to an expired visa, if a student’s visa is cancelled in Australia, they will not be eligible for the grant of most types of visas, including a further Student visa in Australia and may then be subject to an ‘Exclusion Period’.
