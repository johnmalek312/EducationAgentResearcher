Under the National Code, education providers must ensure that pastoral care as part of their student programs and systems. This includes appointing staff that are specialists in counselling and advising international students, who are located either in faculties, departments or in special student support offices.

In secondary schools, these support people may also be teaching staff with additional responsibilities. 

Students should be encouraged to:

  * seek help from specialised staff as soon as they think they need it and
  * take the opportunity to learn about living and studying in Australia before and after they arrive.



A range of support is provided by:

  * International student advisers
  * Student counsellors
  * Support specialists
  * Learning and language support personnel
  * Student organisations
  * Accommodation officers
  * Community support personnel
  * Law enforcement workers



### International Student Advisers

An International Student Adviser has a range of responsibilities and often provides the first point of contact for students seeking advice on a range of matters. The responsibilities might include:

  * Welcoming new students at orientation programs
  * Planning and delivering activities and events for students
  * Developing student support programs, including peer support
  * Preparing information for students to assist them with questions
  * Discussion with individual students in relation to their student experience
  * Referring students to relevant services and specialised support
  * Liaising with external bodies such as DIBP, and community groups
  * Communicating with and supporting student organisations
  * Providing advice to faculty staff about the specific needs of international students
  * Providing individual advice and support for students about: 
    * Settling into accommodation
    * Cultural adjustment
    * Academic progress
    * Where to find appropriate services 
    * Basic information about visa compliance.



### Student counsellors

Student Counsellors may be the same people as International Student Advisers, but generally a counsellor is a person specialised in psychological welfare, mental health and sometimes cross-cultural issues.

Students are encouraged to seek help from counsellors, as these people are trained to maintain students’ confidentiality, and have special skills. Australian students are familiar with the role of a counsellor and often find that talking over personal problems is a very good way to solve issues.

Within universities counsellors are also informed about language, learning and health issues, and can refer students to the right person for their needs.

### Support specialists

Many large providers employ specialist support staff to help students with disabilities and other issues. Universities are obliged to provide this kind of support.

Students should be advised to talk to their Enrolment Officer or International Student Adviser before they enrol, or when they arrive if they think they will need assistance with a disability. This might include:

  * note-takers for deaf students
  * wheelchair access to buildings
  * special learning support and/or
  * special support at exam time.



### Learning and language support personnel

A key part of pastoral care for international students is the support available for their academic studies. Language and learning support can assist in the following areas:

  * Studying in an Australian education environment
  * Developing independent learning skills
  * Writing essays and assignments
  * Participating in tutorials
  * Giving presentations 
  * Doing research and using libraries.



### Student organisations

On all university campuses and in many colleges student groups are active to represent the interests of the students enrolled. For international students these include:

  * Cultural groups
  * National groups
  * Special interest groups
  * Postgraduate groups 
  * Religious groups.



### Accommodation officers

Many students find that rental accommodation, living in homestay arrangements and balancing budgets are stressful. In most large institutions there will be Accommodation Officers who can assist and advise students with these common problems:

  * Signing a residential lease and not understanding the language on the documents
  * Being responsible for bills when a house-mate moves out
  * Finding communication difficult with house-mates
  * Being unfamiliar with appropriate and acceptable behaviour when dealing with others
  * Having responsibility for large sums of money, including fees
  * Finding that part-time work does not sufficiently help with costs
  * Balancing education and part-time work responsibilities
  * Being unaware of rights as employees in part-time jobs.



### Community support personnel

Along with special staff in universities colleges and schools, many support personnel in the community can provide services to students. These include:

  * Health professionals (eg. doctors, dentists, psychologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists)
  * Counsellors
  * Religious groups and churches
  * Municipal support (eg. town councils)
  * Ethnic and cultural groups
  * Consulates 
  * National-based associations.



### Law enforcement workers

Students may find the laws and regulations in Australia very different from their home countries. However, students should understand that laws relating to safety, security, privacy and protection are intended to ensure that people’s rights are protected.

If a student witnesses a crime or is a victim of a crime, then the police should be contacted. Most Australian States have police units, which specialise in crime and public safety issues relating to immigrant groups and international students. Students should be confident in trusting police to deal with safety and security issues.

Security staff at many large colleges and universities are trained to help international students when in trouble or when they feel their security is threatened. Students who report threats, crimes, or any other issues to security staff, police, or staff at their education institution have the right to have these issues kept confidential.
