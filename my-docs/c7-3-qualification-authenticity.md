The relationship between an institution and their agent is based on trust. An agent should help institutions recognise any irregularities in students’ applications as part of ensuring that the student is genuine in their wish to undertake studies in Australia.

In particular, **submitting forged or inauthentic documentation on behalf of a student is a serious matter and is likely to lead to an agent’s contract being terminated by an institution unless it can be demonstrated that the agent was also deceived by the student.**

It is extremely difficult to determine the main source countries of forged documents, where they are produced and how they are obtained. The Internet and other black market sources make them easily accessible across the globe.

One guide is to assess countries on their perceived level of risk with regard to corruption and risk of falsification. To do this you can use the Corruption Perceptions Index ([CPI](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/)) developed by Transparency International, which has developed a ranking of corruption. The CPI ranks a total of nearly 200 countries and provides a score between 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly law-abiding). See the following table for the CPI of the major student enrolments to Australia:

**Ranking by source****of student numbers****for Australia**| **Country of source****of students****for Australia**| **Ranking of****country on CPI****(/180)**| **CPI****(/100)**  
---|---|---|---  
1| China| 66| 45  
2| India| 85| 40  
3| South Korea| 32| 62  
4| Vietnam| 87| 39  
5| Malaysia| 62| 48  
6| Thailand| 110| 35  
7| Indonesia| 96| 38

### **Identifying Forged Documentation**

You may come across these 5 methods of forgery:

**Method**| **Examples**  
---|---  
**Forged qualifications**  
| These are created to represent a legitimate or fictitious institution, and/or program of study.  
  


  * They are either purchased from the Internet/another black market source or created by the holder themselves.
  * The quality of the documents varies from perfect replicas through to very poor reproductions.

  
**Altered documents**|  These are official, legitimate documents that may have been altered through omissions, additions or changes. These alterations can include (but are not limited to) changes in:  
  


  * the date of birth
  * dates of attendance
  * initial enrolment and graduation dates
  * grades and/or
  * course content.

  
**Manufactured in-house**|  These are documents produced by corrupt employees located within the educational institution. Cases can include both altered and fabricated documents in the national language or the language of the receiving country and designed ‘specifically for foreign consumption.’ The changes may be that:  
  


  * grades are inflated
  * contact hours/credits can be inflated
  * professional titles or degrees are awarded for programs that represent only completion of a partial or intermediate qualification.

  
**Interpretative translations**|  These are inaccurate translations of documents, which are interpretative in nature and systematically misleading. Samples include:  
  


  * the literal translation of the Latin American high school diploma of ‘bachiller’ into ‘Bachelor’
  * the conversion of grades into the US grade scale (A to F);
  * the translation of course titles to comparable subjects in the receiving country to enhance the possibility of credit transfer.

  
**Official copies of forged qualifications**|  These documents have been photocopied and then authenticated from an official source. Note that documents that have been certified by a Justice of the Peace (Notary Public) have the potential to be forged.  
  
### Recognising Inauthentic Documents

Some possible clues that a document may not be authentic are as follows:

**Problem with:**| **Examples**  
---|---  
**Information**| 

  * Chronology of study period does not make sense or match claims on application form
  * Program of study did not exist at the claimed time the candidate undertook the program
  * Inappropriate or outdated signatures
  * Cultural and anachronistic inconsistencies (dates, institutional name changes, institutional mergers, institutional closures)
  * Educational aberrations (hours of study, uncharacteristic grading system, years of study, program cancellations)
  * Numerical aberrations: credits do not add up and overall grade point averages (GPA) are a mathematical impossibility
  * Unusually high grades and/or presence of high grades in countries where higher grade ranges are virtually nonexistent
  * Creative translations showing American grades, American courses titles, an uncharacteristic or exorbitant number of credit or hours per class.

  
**Language**| 

  * Misspellings, unprofessional language or poor grammar are present on academic documents
  * Incorrect terminology
  * Non-traditional format of transcripts or grade certificates prepared in a language other than the official language of the country where the document originated.

  
**Appearance**| 

  * Awkward or forced lettering
  * Inconsistent fonts and/or incompatible type-face in a single document
  * Weak or incorrect seals/emblems, colours, shapes
  * Blurry emblems
  * Scanned images
  * Cut-and-paste quality
  * Incorrect paper quality, texture, size (letter or legal), colouration
  * Lack of watermarks or the obvious appearance of hand-made watermarks
  * Incorrect diacritical marks
  * Lack of holograms or other safety measures
  * Missing pictures in Diplomas or professional identification cards
  * Partial seals on the surface of superimposed pictures but not on the document surface
  * Irregular spacing between words or letters, or insufficient space for the text
  * Poor ink colour and quality
  * Signature aberrations including shading and continuity.

  
**Corrections**| 

  * Evidence of corrected personal data (name, birth date, gender)
  * Evidence of white-out, burn-marks, or erasures
  * Interrupted/obliterated lines where information is generally typed or printed.
