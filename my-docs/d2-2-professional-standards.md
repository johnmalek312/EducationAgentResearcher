Successful education agents demonstrate ‘professionalism’ and comply with professional standards. This means they are committed to their clients, deliver high and consistent levels of service, and have ethical practices.

Some important examples of proper standards are given below:

### Dealing with students

**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  
---|---  
Providing sufficient and accurate information to students| Students need to able to make an appropriate choice of course and/or institution.  
Keeping adequate records| It is essential that agents keep clear and organised records regarding:

  * information provided to students
  * biographical data
  * copies of documents they have submitted as part of applications
  * copies of correspondence with institutions about a particular application
  * relevant student visa documentation.

  
Maintaining contact after a course has begun| Agents should continue to maintain contact and help students with relevant issues as they arise.  
Having clear cost structures| Students should be made aware of:  


  * relevant the costs involved in using an agent
  * when and how this money should be paid
  * what is not included within an agent’s services.

  
Responding to questions in a timely manner| Agents should answer questions from their students within a reasonable time period.  
  
### Dealing with institutions

**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  
---|---  
Submitting applications to institutions only from students who have a genuine intention to study| 

  * Sending applications to a range of institutions for an individual student can be what a student requests in order to find out the range of options they have. However, agents need to be aware that submitting an application to an institution that the student has no realistic chance or intention of attending creates unnecessary administrative work for both the institution and the agent.
  * Institutions expect their agents to filter applications and do not appreciate the considerable work generated to assess an individual for entry unnecessarily. In practice, many agencies limit students to applying to no more than 3 institutions at a time.
  * At times, students may seek to use multiple agencies to apply to as many institutions as possible.

  
Communicating appropriately with organisations| Agents should identify the appropriate individuals to contact in regard to:  


  * student inquiries
  * applications
  * enrolments
  * recruitment
  * problems that arise.

Agents should consider whether email or other forms of communication are the most appropriate form for any particular situation. An email can provide a clear record of what is being communicated and it’s a very popular form of communication. But, in some circumstances it may be necessary to discuss an issue by telephone and then follow up with an email to confirm what has been understood.  
Representing the institution and its courses accurately| Agents should have a clear understanding of the institutions they represent. This includes:  


  * having a reasonably detailed understanding of the local environment and facilities available to students
  * understanding what a particular course of study involves
  * knowing what employment can be expected following the successful completion of a course.

  
Advertising with approval| Agents should ensure that an institution has explicitly agreed to any advertising. This includes using the crest or symbol of an organisation to market an exhibition or publication.  
  
At times, agents believe that having an agent agreement with an institution provides them with the right to use their materials and symbols at any time. However, institutions should always be informed of when their name and reputation is being used.  
  
  
**Dealing with other agents**

**Examples:**| **Explanations:**  
---|---  
Not discounting fees without an institution being aware| Some agents offer discounts on students’ tuition fees by paying a portion of the institution’s tuition fees themselves. In this manner they seek to encourage more students to their agency. The institution is normally unaware that this is occurring.   
  
While as a business strategy this is not necessarily wrong or illegal, often agents who are not planning a long-term business strategy undertake this practice. They can be individuals without office premises (and the costs that go with this) who work alone. They calculate that if they can recruit enough students in this manner, the commission they receive from the institution will cover the sum that they have discounted. Unfortunately, they commonly provide very little (if any) service once a student has been placed and are focused only on the recruitment of more individuals not on providing quality service.  
  
Other, more established, long-term agencies lose business to these types of agents because they have larger business overheads and provide a comprehensive service. In the end, many of the students recruited by such short-term agents end up dealing with the more established agents when they need help once their studies have begun.  
  
It is important for agents to realise that business practices that drive other agents out of business with unsustainable discounts are ultimately bad for all. They lower the reputation of agents as a whole and focus the agent community on recruitment alone rather than quality service.
