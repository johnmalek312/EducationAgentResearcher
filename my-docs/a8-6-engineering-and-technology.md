### Qualifications

Engineering and Technology programs are offered at the following qualification levels:

  * Certificate
  * Diploma
  * Advanced Diploma
  * Bachelor Degree
  * Graduate Certificate
  * Postgraduate Diploma
  * Masters by research/coursework
  * Professional Doctorates/PhD



TAFE and private colleges typically offer vocational programs through Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas, which allow students to become Technicians and Engineering Assistants. Universities offer more specialised Bachelor Degrees, Graduate Certificates, Postgraduate Diplomas, Masters, Professional Doctorates and PhDs. These programs allow students to practise as professional Engineers.

There are some exceptions though. Some TAFEs and Colleges might offer Bachelor programs and Universities may offer Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs. Pathways are available for students wishing to link their programs and reduce the amount of time of their total study.

### Vocational Education and Training Programs

Vocational Education programs offered through TAFE and private colleges lead students to careers as associate professionals. The majority of these programs include work placements and internships allowing students to gain on-the-job experience before graduation.

Typical programs offered at this level include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Certificate| Certificate IV in Information Technology;  
Certificate IV in Multimedia;  
Certificate IV in Technology in Electronic Engineering.  
Diploma| Diploma of Airport Management;  
Diploma of Structural Engineering;  
Diploma of Information Technology (Software Development).  
Advanced Diploma| Advanced Diploma of Information Technology (E Business or E Security);  
Advanced Diploma of Engineering.  
  
Typically, engineering streams have higher entry requirements than the technology streams. Examples of the range of entry requirements are below:

  * **Advanced Diploma of Computer Systems Engineering** – entry is generally only available through articulated entry from Certificate III to Certificate IV to Diploma. Students with prior study in this area may complete a bridging program for admission.
  * **Certificate IV in Information Technology (Client Support)** – students generally must have completed Australian grade 10 or equivalent (such as Mathayom Suksa Yr 5; O Levels; Taiwanese High School).
  * **Diploma of Information Technology (Software Development)** – admission is based on a student completing the equivalent to Australian grade 12 (or A Levels; STMP; All-Indian Secondary School Certificate) or articulated entry from a Certificate IV program.



### University Programs

Completion of a degree at university level allows students to practise as professional Engineers. Programs are devised in conjunction with [Engineers Australia](http://www.ieaust.org.au/) and the [Australian Computer Society](http://www.acs.org.au/). Examples of programs include:

LEVEL| QUALIFICATION  
---|---  
Undergraduate| Bachelor of Arts (Computer Science/Information Management/Information Technology);  
Bachelor of Applied Science;  
Bachelor of Computer Science;  
Bachelor of Engineering;  
Bachelor of Information Technology;  
Bachelor of Information Systems;  
Bachelor of Technology.  
Postgraduate| Graduate Certificate of Information Technology;  
Postgraduate Diploma of Engineering;  
Masters by coursework/research; and  
PhD.  
  
### Undergraduate

Many universities offer a common first year for Engineering students and then start to specialise in their second year. Similar to vocational education the Engineering streams have higher entry requirements than Technology courses. For example:

  * **Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science** – entry requirements range from 5 points at A Levels with no subject prerequisites to 10 points at A Levels including a prerequisite subject of Mathematics.
  * **Bachelor of Engineering** – entry requirements range from 5 points at A Levels with subject prerequisites of Mathematics, Physics and or Chemistry to 11 points at A Levels and Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry prerequisites.



### Postgraduate

Postgraduate programs for Engineering students are generally offered at advanced levels. Within the technology disciplines there are several conversion graduate programs offered. These programs are available for non-technology graduates. For example:

  * **Masters of Information Technology** – admission is based on a student completing the equivalent to an Australian Bachelor Degree in any other discipline than Information Technology to a student with an equivalent Australian Bachelor Degree in an Information Technology discipline.
  * **Masters of Engineering** – students must have completed equivalent to an Australian Bachelor of Engineering Degree.



### Pathways

There are limited pathways linking vocational and university level programs. These are more common in the Technology field than the Engineering field, although a limited number of private colleges have partnered with universities to offer Engineering pathways.

### Professional Associations

The majority of programs offered within the Engineering and Technology discipline are developed in coordination with the appropriate professional body. The courses usually offer internships and work placement. For example, TAFE offers traineeship programs for students already employed in their preferred industry.

Graduates may be eligible for membership of one of the following professional bodies:

Engineering| 

  * [Engineers Australia](http://www.ieaust.org.au/)
  * The Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists & Managers, Australia ([APESMA](http://www.apesma.asn.au/))
  * Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ([IEEE](http://www.computer.org/)) Computer Society
  * World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([WFEO](http://www.wfeo.org/))
