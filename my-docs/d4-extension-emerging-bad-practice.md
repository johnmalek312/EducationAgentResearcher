# D4. Extension: Emerging Bad Practice

While only a small proportion of the agent community, a few individuals in our industry seek to gain advantage by unethical means and they will seek ways to avoid scrutiny. The following examples of problematic practices are emerging and are damaging to the reputation of everybody working in recruiting students for Australia.

**Emerging Issues with SVP**

The Streamlined Visa Processing (SVP) regime has enabled certain students and their agents to gain student visas as part of a SVP package of study but without any intention of studying at the nominated institution. Once arriving in Australia, some students are withdrawing immediately from the institution they had enrolled in and are transferring to other ‘cheaper’ institutions often in different sectors. This is resulting in the original recruiting institution spending considerable administrative time for no benefit and the original institution ultimately bearing responsibility for these students under the SVP rules. It also supports a culture of “course hopping”.

Some Agents are facilitating this by:

  * Producing **fraudulent documents** to meet entry requirements or to support requests of withdrawal from studies and transfer to other providers. There have been cases of letters of offer altered by agents, particularly with changes to the amount of fees charged.
  * Cases of **fake flight tickets** to support withdrawal requests were discovered by a number of providers. There was an instance where a significant number of tickets had the same reference number and were paid with the same credit card.
  * **Early visa approvals** , often two months before formal commencement of courses, are creating the issue of non-genuine students having the opportunity to find alternative programs and withdraw from their original provider, before starting their studies.
  * Some regional providers identified the issues of **students being misled** by agents in regards to the provider’s **location**. An example was provided where students enrolled in an institution located in the Sunshine Coast but had to commute every day from Brisbane (over 1 hour). 
  * A **network of people** , including education and migration agents and representatives from poor quality education and training institutions, appear to be active in providing information to international students on arrival – particularly in regards to course hopping and other **poor practices**. Letters requesting withdrawals are usually written very clearly and professionally, with references to relevant ESOS legislation showing a command of English above that of the student themselves. A number of letters have been identified as identical, suggesting the systematic support of non-genuine students in some cases. These students requesting transfers between providers are usually not interested in counselling or intervention strategies.
