The Australian Government’s risk assessment and management approach to the registration and ongoing monitoring of CRICOS registered providers means stronger, more robust and more visible compliance requirements. This is reflected in the National Code 2018.

Standard 4 has been strengthened so that conditions of written agreements and agent behaviour are clearer, to ensure that an agent:

  * does not engage in false or misleading conduct,
  * declares and avoids conflicts of interest,
  * observes appropriate levels of confidentiality and transparency in dealing with students,
  * acts honestly and in good faith.
  * understands and meets the expectations of the Australian International Education and Training Agent Code of Ethics. Ethical behavior is discussed in the [Ethics (ETH)](https://eatc.onlinetrainingnow.com/courses/education-agent-training-course/pages/ethics-eth) section of this course.



A registered provider is obliged to take corrective action, including terminate its relationship with an agent, if it is aware of breaches of these principles.

**Conflict of interest**

Registered providers must require their education agents to avoid conflicts of interests.

Examples of conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * when the agent charges services fees to both overseas students and registered providers for the same service
  * where an education agent has a financial interest in a private education provider;
  * where an employee of an education agent has a personal relationship with an employee of the education provider.



The National Code at 4.3 states that a registered provider must require its education agent to:

4.3.1 declare in writing and take reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interests with its duties as an education agent of the registered provider.

**Written agreements**

Registered providers must have a written agreement with each education agent that formally represents their education services, and enter and maintain the education agent’s details in PRISMS. If an agent does not comply with the terms of the conditions, the provider must take corrective action.

Corrective action may include:

  * providing additional information/material or targeted training in, for example, the expectations of the provider
  * refusal to accept any more students from the agent
  * not allowing the agent to use PRISMS for them
  * deciding not to work with the agent
  * terminating the agreement with the education agent.



In 4.2 of the National Code 2018 states that the written agreement between a provider and their agents must outline:

4.2.1 the responsibilities of the registered provider, including that the registered provider is responsible at all times for compliance with the ESOS Act and National Code 2018

4.2.2 the registered provider’s requirements of the agent in representing the registered provider as outlined in Standard 4.3

4.2.3 the registered provider’s processes for monitoring the activities of the education agent in representing the provider, and ensuring the education agent is giving students accurate and up-to-date information on the registered provider’s services

4.2.4 the corrective action that may be taken by the registered provider if the education agent does not comply with its obligations under the written agreement including providing for corrective action outlined in Standard 4.4

4.2.5 the registered provider’s grounds for termination of the registered provider’s written agreement with the education agent, including providing for termination in the circumstances outlined in Standard 4.5

4.2.6 the circumstances under which information about the education agent may be disclosed by the registered provider and the Commonwealth or state or territory agencies.
