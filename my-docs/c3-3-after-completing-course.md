When the student has completed all of the requirements of an academic program, they are eligible to graduate.

An agent has no active role in a studentâ€™s graduation in Australia. However, if the institution conducts overseas graduation ceremonies, they may request that you attend or be involved in the organisation of the ceremony.

### Post-Graduation

After graduation a student may come to you to investigate their future options. You may be asked to give advice on:

  * Postgraduate study options
  * Alumni Functions
  * Returning to Australia on a Work* or Tourist Visa
  * Permanent Residency* in Australia



***_Note:_**  
_If you are operating in Australia, you can only answer visa enquiries if you are a Registered Migration Agent (RMA). If you are not an RMA, you must refer your client to someone who is._  
_If you are located overseas, you can answer visa questions._
