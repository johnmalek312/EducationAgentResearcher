An **CoE** is a **Confirmation of Enrolment**. This is a web-based document created by PRISMS that records which course or courses a student is enrolled in.

If a student intends to study more than one course, more than one CoE is produced. This allows the student to get a student visa for the combined length of all the courses. This is often referred to as a ‘Package’ visa.

### Producing a CoE

These are the steps that are followed:

  1. The provider agrees to enrol the student.
  2. The provider authorises and prints a copy of the CoE and provides it to the student and/or agent.
  3. The information on the CoE is transmitted to DHA via PRISMS.
  4. When the student applies for a student visa, DHA matches and approves the CoE details.
