### Participants

  * You â€“ a counsellor working in an agency
  * Another counsellor working in a different agency



### Situation

  * The other counsellor would like you to work with her and her agency. If she has a student who wants to go to a university that you represent but she does not, she will send the application form to you and you will process it.
  * Vice versa: if you get a student for an institution she has representation for, then you will send the application form to her.
  * You can share the commission in these cases.



### Considerations

  * How will you agree to share the work and is there a written agreement to do so?
  * Are the institutions involved aware of or likely to agree to this practice?
  * Will the institutions find out?
