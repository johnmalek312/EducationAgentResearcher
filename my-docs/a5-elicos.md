### Overview

The ELICOS sector is a very important one in the Australian education system. This is because it:

  * provides international students with a wide variety of options to learn English;
  * enables students to enter other education sectors at all levels.



**Because there are such a large number of courses available, you need to be confident in selecting the right one for your students. This is especially true if they want to continue studying in Australia after completing their ELICOS course.**

### Focus Questions

  1. Which types of ELICOS centres exist in Australia?
  2. Which types of ELICOS courses would be suitable for a student who wants to continue studying in another sector?
  3. How are other short courses different from ELICOS courses?
  4. Which English language proficiency tests are accepted in Australia?
  5. What are the usual language requirements to enter a VET course?
  6. How is the quality of ELICOS courses maintained?
