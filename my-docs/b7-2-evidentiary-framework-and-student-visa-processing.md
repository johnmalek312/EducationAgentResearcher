### Overview

All student visa applications follow a similar process, with students providing information in an online form to DHA which is then assessed in accordance with established guidelines. Experience has demonstrated that in the aggregate, applications from different countries and for different education providers, indicate different rates of student fraud and other visa cancellation events.

The Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF) provides the evidentiary requirements for each student application on the basis of a combination of the rating of the student’s country of citizenship and the rating of the provider with which they will undertake their principal course of study.

These ratings are updated each 6 month period on the basis of:

  * Rate of visa cancellations
  * Rate of visa refusal due to fraud
  * Rate of visa refusal not due to fraud
  * Rate of student visa holder becoming unlawful (overstaying their time in Australia)
  * Rate of student visa holders applying for a Protection visa



Applications with regular evidentiary requirements are required to provide evidence of English proficiency and financial capacity with their applications, while those classed as streamlined are generally able to satisfy the Department of their financial capacity by a declaration and are not generally required to provide evidence of their English language proficiency. However, DHA retains the discretion to seek further evidence where appropriate.

Applicants who provide all requested documentation with their visa application are generally processed quicker. 

Note that a student’s nationality is determined by:

  * the nationality that is recorded in the student’s passport at the date of the application;
  * not where the student lives;
  * not where the student applies for the student visa.



#### Evidentiary Framework and Evidence Levels

The SSVF ‘evidentiary framework’ is based on student immigration outcomes over a period of time. It serves only to guide whether a Student visa applicant is subject to streamlined (S) or regular (R) evidentiary requirements. Ratings are calculated using a weighted average based on the total numbers of international students (applicants and holders of Student visas) that have a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) to study a course from the education provider.

The following weightings and indicators are used to calculate the evidence level of each education provider and country:

**Rate of visa cancellations (25% weighting)**

The proportion of cases, once a student has been provided a visa which was then cancelled due to:

  * non-genuineness
  * fraud
  * breaches of visa condition 8202 (i.e. maintaining enrolment, attendance and course progress)
  * breaches of work condition 8105 (i.e. cannot work more than 40 hours per fortnight when course is in session)
  * breaches of other visa conditions



**_NOTE: There are temporary 8104 and 8105 visa conditions that allow students to work more than 40 hours per fortnight, and similar allowances for family members. See[here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/see-your-visa-conditions?product=500#) and [here](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500/temporary-relaxation-of-working-hours-for-student-visa-holders)._**

Student visa cancellations where the student personally requests visa cancellation are not included. For example, a student who has ceased study and returned home may request visa cancellation.

**Rate of refusals due to a fraud reason where the applicant lodged overseas (40% weighting)**

The proportion of students who were refused a visa at the application stage due to fraud. If a visa is refused because of fraud, this measure will apply regardless of whether or not any other refusal reason exists.

##### 

**Rate of refusals (excluding fraud) where the applicant lodged overseas (10% weighting)**

The proportion of how many students were refused a visa at the application stage due to reasons other than fraud. That is, one of the legal requirements for the grant of the visa was not met and no fraud was detected. For example, not meeting the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE), health or other requirements.

##### 

**Rate of student visa holders becoming unlawful non-citizens (15% weighting)**

The number of students that have overstayed their student visa for more than 28 days. Students who have been unlawful and resolve their immigration status within 28 days are not counted. These figures represent those visa holders who did not contact the Department to arrange a Bridging visa or another visa and overstayed their visa for more than 28 days.

##### 

**Rate of Subsequent Protection Visa applications (10% weighting)**

The proportion of students who applied for a Protection Visa (PV) where the last visa held by them was a Student visa.

#### Evidence Level Allocation

Evidence level ratings are allocated to each education provider and country as follows:

**Index****(Weighted average of all indicators)**| **Evidence level rating**  
---|---  
Below 1.0| One  
Between 1.0 and 2.70| Two  
Above 2.70| Three  
  
An education provider is linked to its students by the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) held at the time the Student visa application was decided. This means that if a Student transfers to another education provider, their Student visa (and any behaviour linked to evidence level ratings) will continue to be linked to the original education provider specified on the CoE. This will continue until the student is granted a further visa.

In cases where there are only a small number of students, statistical calculations of evidence level are unreliable. Such ‘small’ providers (or countries) are those who have less than 50 active students studying on a principal course at any one time during the previous 12 months.

Small providers are given a default rating of Two.

Countries who supply less than 50 students are given a default rating of Three.

These ratings are updated each 6 months from the historical data generated during the previous 12 month period. DHA do not publicise the actual evidence level rating of any country or provider, it is expressed through the interaction of the two ratings as described in the model below.

#### Evidence Level Model

The following table provides an overview of the students that receive streamlined evidentiary requirements under the SSVF.

Eligibility for streamlined evidentiary requirements is determined on the combined evidence level rating of the student’s country and citizenship and intended education provider.

In the table S refers to streamlined evidentiary requirements while R refers to regular evidentiary requirements. Where regular evidentiary requirements apply the student will generally be required to provide evidence of their financial and English language capacity with their visa application.

  * The majority of students (more than 80%) will be eligible for streamlined arrangements.
  * DHA reserve the right to ask any student who might be eligible for streamlined arrangements to demonstrate their ability to meet the regular criteria.
