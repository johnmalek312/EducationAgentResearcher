### Overview

**The National Code of Practice 2018**

For Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students to achieve the intended purposes of the ESOS Act, the legislation also provides a National Code of Practice. This can be found at Part 4, Division 2 of the [ESOS Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00292).

The National Code 2018 commenced on 1 January 2018. Education providers must comply with the National Code to maintain their registration to provide education services to overseas students.

The Code covers the conduct of education providers delivering services to overseas students. It places clear responsibilities on all educational providers and their agents. Summary documents of the Code and its key requirements can be found [here](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Regulatory-Information/Pages/National-Code-2018-Factsheets-.aspx).

**How does The National Code relate to Agents?**

An agent’s behaviour is the direct responsibility of the education provider if there is an agreement with that provider. So, if you make a mistake or behave dishonestly, the education provider will be held responsible for your actions.

**How is the National Code 2018 organised?**

The National Code is composed of 11 Standards. Standard 4, in particular, sets out that registered education providers must ensure that their education agents act ethically, honestly and in the best interests of overseas students as well as uphold the reputation of Australia’s international education sector. Registered providers need to enter and maintain details of education agents with whom they have a written agreement in PRISMS.
