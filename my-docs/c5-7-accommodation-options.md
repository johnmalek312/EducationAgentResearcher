A variety of high standard student accommodation is available to suit different budgets and needs.

Institutions usually provide students with help in finding accommodation and understanding lease and tenancy conditions. Temporary accommodation can be arranged before they leave home allowing time on arrival to consider where and how they would like to be accommodated in the longer term. Student noticeboards and newspapers often advertise rooms, apartments and houses for rent.

Following is a summary of accommodation options available:

**OPTION**| **APPROX COST***|  **FEATURES**  
---|---|---  
Homestay| AUD290 – AUD310 per week| 

  * It is possible for students to gain access to the Australian lifestyle in a natural and friendly way through homestay.
  * This is popular with younger students and those studying short-term English courses.
  * Some meals are usually included in the cost.
  * Single or shared rooms may be offered and the cost will vary accordingly.
  * Self-catering homestay is sometimes available cheaply.
  * Farmstay offers the same services in a rural setting, and for short stays.

Institutions maintain a register of families prepared to accommodate international students during the academic year. Education providers ensure that homestay families are reputable and that they offer accommodation of a reasonable standard.
