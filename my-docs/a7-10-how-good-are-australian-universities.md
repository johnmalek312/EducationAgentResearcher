Australia has traditionally been the home of inventors and scientists right from its early settlement. This happened partly out of necessity because in its early days, Australia was a long way from the rest of the industrialised world; they had to rely on what could be produced locally. It is also true that the Australian education system (especially the universities) are responsible for developing a culture of innovation and discovery.

This culture of innovation aims to:

  * make the best use of national and international information networks
  * encourage creativity in all forms of research
  * promote collaboration between university researchers and industry and
  * disseminate the outcomes of research to the wider community.



Australian scientists and researchers have been responsible for many advances in business and industry, and have made significant contributions in medical science. Australia has been a pioneer in solar energy research and other potential energy sources. Australian advances in technology include the development of the black box flight recorder, bionic ear implants, a heart pacemaker, the vaccine for cancer of the cervix, and computer hardware and software. Australia is also at the forefront of producing new technologies such as wave-piercing ocean catamarans, solar-powered cars and the revolutionary orbital engine.

Australians have won prestigious international awards including eight Nobel prizes:

2005 Medicine

1995 Medicine

1975 Chemistry

1973 Literature

1963 Medicine

1960 Medicine

1945 Medicine
