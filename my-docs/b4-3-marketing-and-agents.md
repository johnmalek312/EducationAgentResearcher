Standard 4 of the National Code 2018 states that that when marketing certain features of a course, agents must describe them accurately. **The provider is responsible for student recruitment** and placement activities, whether undertaken by the provider themselves or their agents. 

Standard 4 of the National code states that:

4.5 Where the registered provider becomes aware, or has reason to believe, that the education agent or an employee or subcontractor of the education agent is engaging in false or misleading recruitment practices, the registered provider must immediately terminate its relationship with the education agent, or require the education agent to terminate its relationship with the employee or subcontractor who engaged in those practices.

The National code at 4.6 states that a registered provider must not accept students from an education agent if it knows or reasonably suspects the education agent to be:

4.6.1 providing migration advice, unless that education agent is authorised to do so under the Migration Act

4.6.2 engaged in, or to have previously engaged in, dishonest recruitment practices, including the deliberate attempt to recruit a student where this clearly conflicts with the obligations of registered providers under Standard 7 (Overseas student transfers)

4.6.3 facilitating the enrolment of a student who the education agent believes will not comply with the conditions of his or her visa

4.6.4 using PRISMS to create CoEs for other than bona fide students.
