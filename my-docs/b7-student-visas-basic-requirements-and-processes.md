### Overview

The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) requires a number of criteria to be met to provide a Student visa:

  * The student must be accepted into full-time study
  * The student must be a genuine temporary entrant
  * The student must meet health and health insurance requirements
  * The student must be of the appropriate age
  * The student must have a “good” character and not have any debts to the Australian Government



In addition, if higher risk criteria apply:

  * The student must provide specified evidence to meet financial requirements
  * The student must demonstrate appropriate English language skills



Furthermore, if the student is under 18 years of age, they must have acceptable arrangements for their accommodation and welfare.

In this section, you’ll learn how these criteria are defined and applied.

The information in these sections apply to persons whose primary intention in coming to Australia is to study, and intend to study for more than 12 weeks. Students who wish to study a short course may be able to do so on other visa classes (e.g. a tourist visa allows study for up to three months). Applicants can use this [Visa Finder](http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1).

#### **Focus Questions**

  * What requirements do students need to meet to obtain a student visa?
  * Why does DHA use a risk-based analysis?
  * What is the relationship between a principal course, and the duration of a visa?
  * How does streamlined evidentiary requirements differ from regular evidentiary requirements?
